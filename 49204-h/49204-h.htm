<h2><a name="COMPILERS_PREFACE" id="COMPILERS_PREFACE"></a>COMPILER’S PREFACE.</h2>

<p>An association of some thirty years with the subject of
these pages, a familiarity with his history gained by opportune
meetings and conversations with comrades now living,
and those since dead&mdash;who were witnesses of the events that
assisted to make the individual prominent&mdash;makes me feel it a
public duty to accede to the publisher’s request to compile a
short, sharp, and veracious account of the unique history of
this picturesque character.</p>

<p>Born at a time, and reared in an atmosphere, the most
romantic and adventurous known in the history of our American
frontier, when the tidal wave of human progress, sweeping
westward, was making history faster than the historians
could record it&mdash;it was his fate to be in the field, and his fortune
to grasp the opportunities to meet the situation’s requirements,
and, in the beaten path of what seemed ordinary daily
duty, to rise, by reason of his sterling qualities, his daring, and
his courage, to the distinction of a leader.</p>

<p>So quickly was the history of the central West recorded,
as to make the Great American Desert of our childhood seem
almost a geographical mirage, a tale of the romancer. It
would seem to be a fairy story were it not for the fact of
its settlement, and the evidences of its now almost ancient
civilization.</p>

<p>The busy, hustling citizen of to-day scarcely has time to
think, and does not realize that the youths of the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Benton, Beal, Fremont, Bridger, and Carson are the relicts of
the perfected history and work that they inaugurated.</p>

<p>One of the most picturesque characters that evoluted from
the peculiar circumstances of the times is “Buffalo Bill,” Gen.
W.&nbsp;F. Cody, N.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;N. The romance, the fiction, woven
around his personality is dispelled in the white light of stern
and veritable facts, just as the golden rays of the morning sun
drive the mist from the mountain-tops.</p>

<p>The compiler of the accompanying pages has attempted
to present to the reader, in a terse, compact compendium of
facts, the story of a career that, if given in a detailed biography,
would absorb volumes, believing that owing to his prominence
at home and abroad the public desire some authentic knowledge
of the notable events in his career. In fact, here are
presented a few plain truths, unadorned, for the benefit of
those too occupied to have heretofore learned the story and
triumphs of the frontier lad of nine years, from the wild
Western scenes of Kansas and Nebraska, from the prairies of
the Platte to the parlors of the East and the palaces of
Europe.</p>

<span class="subhead">INTRODUCTORY.</span></h2>

<p>Half a century or less ago, the people then active in the
world were unable to move from place to place more rapidly
than in the days before the Christian era. The fickle winds
drove ships out of their course and baffled their efforts to hold
on their way to their destination. On land the rapidity of
progress from place to place was measured by the fleetness of
a horse. The steam-engine was in its infancy; the telegraph
and other electrical devices were only known through the
fable of the singing tree and the talking fountain in the tales
of the Arabian Nights; glittering gold still lay unheeded and
unseen in the beds of California streams.</p>

<p>The great peaks of the Rockies towered into the clouds,
their grandeur and beauty unknown to a world which had
not then heard the sound of the waters thundering down the
cliffs of the Yosemite, a rival of Niagara. Amid the beauties
of the Garden of the Gods reigned a stillness as profound
as that which pervaded the Garden of Eden before the
creation of man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
But already the fearless and restless white man was on
discovery bent, and, with his face turned always toward the
setting sun, one by one the glories of the continent were seen
and heralded.</p>

<p>Brev.-Capt. John C. Fremont of the United States Topographical
Engineers, with the famous Kit Carson as his guide,
was exploring and opening up the great trail which was to
connect the two oceans.</p>

<p>The fur traders were settling in the Northwest, and Astoria
was coming into notice, while the echoes of Bonneville’s
adventures were heard in the Eastern world.</p>

<p>Among the men who found the East growing crowded was
Isaac Cody, who was then living in Iowa. He was a fine type
of the Western frontiersman, well educated, enterprising, and
fearless. Leaving his home, with his family he started across
the plains. His journey continued until he reached a point in
Kansas near Fort Leavenworth, and here he made camp and
proceeded to build a new home.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Little Billy</span>” was then a boy, living the life and learning
the lessons of the plains, while Humboldt was wondering
what secrets were hidden in the center of the continent, and
the geographical societies of the world were speculating upon
the mysteries that lay far beyond the banks of the “Father
of Waters.”</p>

<p>At that time this region was as little known and as dark
a continent as Africa before the courage of Stanley laid bare
its conformation and geography. The Indians had not then
been confined to reservations, but were fiercely resisting the
encroachments of the white men upon their territory. They
disputed, step by step, the advancement to the westward of
the borders of civilization with a fiercer, because more ignorant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
determination to resist subjugation than is known in the
history of the world.</p>

<p>In this atmosphere, and amid such surroundings, this boy
grew up, and his rapid development was a natural result of
such conditions. Physical exercise in the open air developed
his frame, and provided the steady hand and quick eye.</p>

<p>Surrounded by enemies, he lived amid dangers so constant
and ever-present that they became part of his daily life, and
fear was unknown. Self-preservation taught him to oppose
strategy with strategy, and to learn the wiles of the red man
in order that he might exist in his country, and study the
habits of the animals infesting the country, for the dual purpose
of avoiding danger and providing himself with food and
raiment. At the same time this wild life broadened his moral
nature, expanded his mind, and prepared it to receive great
truths. Broad men are the product of broad countries; narrowness
and prejudice are insular.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Dilke has recorded the history of “Greater
Britain,” but during the lifetime of this frontier boy he has
seen with his own eyes the growth of “Greater America.” In
the short span of a life still in its prime, he has seen the slow
wagon-train crawling over the weary miles of wind-swept
prairie harassed by Indians and other foes, and he has seen
the long parallel iron rails push their way across the map of
the continent until they span it from gulf to gulf and
from ocean to ocean. The “prairie schooner” and the pony
express have in his time given way to the Pullman coach and
the electric wire.</p>

<p>In his boyhood the strife and struggles, the perils and privations,
which had beset the Puritans in New England a century
before, were being reënacted on the Western plains; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
of this period in the development of our country this boy can
truthfully say, “All of which I saw, and part of which I
was.”</p>

<p>In later life, when great military commanders intrusted
their lives, and those of their men, to his keeping, they did it
with an unhesitating confidence, begotten of the knowledge
that he was born and trained upon the spot; a veritable product
of the soil. His father having died while he was still
young, he matured early. His widowed mother taught the
boy at her knee the elements of reading and writing, and thus
laid the foundation of an education which has been completed
in the school of the world.</p>

<p>Living for years in cabins or tents, and oftener under the
canopy of heaven, pursuing a career of independent activity
which carried him through the various stages of cattle-herder,
teamster, bronco “buster,” wagon-master, stage-driver, pony-express
rider, hunter, guide, scout, and soldier, he still found
time to acquire an education which, added to his native refinement
and gentleness of bearing, enables him to appear to
advantage in any society or place. While perfection exists
only in the other world, and is not claimed for him, the herder
and scout has borne inspection, and passed muster, in the
accepted centers of refinement and cultivation of the world.</p>

<p>From the Rocky Mountains to the Colosseum at Rome is
a “far cry,” and yet that is the history of the settler’s son now
known around the world as Col. William F. Cody, or “Buffalo
Bill.”</p>

<p>The pages of this book are not devoted to the recording
of a legend wherein the untutored, wild, and reckless roamer
of the plains has by chance, or the magic of phenomenal
powers, won the open sesame to the grandeur of patriarchal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
palaces, but rather to the telling of how native courage and
brilliant daring combined with sincerity of purpose and purity
of motive have made savage warriors of the prairies to welcome
and appreciate the joys of peace, have opened in the heart
of apparently desert places storehouses of wealth, and shown
princely powers that manhood, prowess, and honor are found
as truly on the prairies of the great West as in the centers of
art and civilization. The sturdy hero of the plains has been
met by gracious hands at the portals of the palace.</p>

<p>The discovery that a new world existed on the western
shores of the Atlantic was scarcely more a surprise to the
grandees of the Old World, than the realization that far
beyond the great Father of Waters there existed a country
whose inhabitants were hunting buffaloes and living in rude
tents on prairies and amid rugged mountains, which needed
but the plow and the miner’s pick for keys to unlock treasuries
filled with richer products and rarer gems than the bright
gleam of the mythical Aladdin’s lamp e’er shone upon.</p>

<p>Now the world recognizes and gives tardy but sincere
applause to the venturesome spirits that first directed the
attention of the world to the grandeur and latent power of
the great West. Occasionally a noble of the East, in search
of sport and adventure, visited this new country and, returning,
told of its vastness and magnificence. Romancers, upon
a few facts, accepted with hesitation, built stories which,
though thoroughly entertaining, were regarded as novels,
never as histories.</p>

<p>Taking up the thread of the beautiful story so graphically
told by the facile pen of Washington Irving in his narration
of the fur traders’ trials, adventures, and discoveries, and
weaving all into a contemporaneous history, our Cody and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
fellows have gathered together the living actual facts of the
prairies, and held them up to the wondering, admiring gaze of
the world in the court-yards of the palaces of Europe. The
barefooted urchin, that, astride of his fleet-footed bronco,
rode with a smile through every danger, carrying news and
cheer from old homes in the East to the strugglers of the
prairies, has since been accorded courtly welcome by crowned
monarchs, to whom he has exhibited in triumph trophies of
American valor and American enterprise. Kingly warriors
have dragged captives chained to their chariot-wheels as
proofs of their victories; subjects have shouted loud pæans of
praise and glory of their lords and princes returning as victors;
but when, save in the history of William F. Cody, have the
conquered walked hand in hand with the conqueror, willing
witnesses to his glorious achievements; or when, before, have
kings and queens and emperors joined in according glad
applause to a victor whose only royal heritage was his native
manhood, and whose only spoils of victory were willing captives
to peace and civilization.</p>

<p>From this man’s life, deeds, and successes others may
glean lessons of endurance and courage in days of trial, of
hope in moments of despair, and of gentleness and generosity
in the hour of triumph.</p>

<p>With the earnest wish that such results may accrue from a
perusal of these pages, let us first recall Buffalo Bill’s record
as a gallant and trusty scout.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SCOUT.</span></h2>

<p>Gen. Richard Irving Dodge, General Sherman’s chief
of staff, correctly states, in his “Thirty Years Among Our
Wild Indians”:</p>

<p>“The success of every expedition against Indians depends,
to a degree, on the skill, fidelity, and intelligence of the men
employed as scouts and guides, for not only is the command
habitually dependent on them for good routes and comfortable
camps, but the officer in command must rely on their
knowledge of the position and movements of the enemy.”</p>

<p>Our best Indian officers are quick to recognize these traits in
those claiming frontier lore, and to no one in the military history
of the West has such deference been shown by them as
to W.&nbsp;F. Cody, as is witnessed by the continuous years of
service he has passed, the different commands he has served,
the expeditions and campaigns he has been identified with,
his repeated holding, when he desired, the position of Chief
of Scouts of the United States Army, and the intimate
association, and contact resulting from it, with Gen. W.&nbsp;T.
Sherman (with whom he was at the making of the Comanche
and Kiowa Treaty) in 1866, Gen. Phil. Sheridan (who has often
given him special recognition and chosen him to organize
expeditions, notably that of the Duke Alexis), old General
Harney, Generals Forsyth, Merritt, Brisbin, Emory, Gibbon,
Terry, McKenzie, Carr, W.&nbsp;S. Hancock, Crook, Pope, Miles,
Ord, Auger, Royall, Hazen, Duncan, Palmer, Penrose, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
the late lamented General Custer. His history, in fact,
would be almost a history of the middle West; and, though
younger, equaling in term of service and in personal adventure,
Kit Carson, old Jim Bridger, California Joe, Wild Bill,
and the rest of his dead associates.</p>

<p>As another evidence of the confidence placed in his frontiersmanship,
it may suffice to mention the celebrities whose
money and position most naturally sought the best protection
the Western market could afford, and who chose to place their
lives in his keeping: Sir George Gore, the Earl of Dunraven,
James Gordon Bennett, Duke Alexis, General Custer, Lawrence
Jerome, Remington, Professor Ward of Rochester,
Professor Marsh of Yale College, Maj. J.&nbsp;G. Hecksher, Doctor
Kingsley (Canon Kingsley’s brother), and others of equal
rank and distinction. In all books of the plains his exploits
with Carr, Miles, and Crook, in the summer of 1876, when
he killed Yellow Hand in front of the military command in
an open hand-to-hand fight, are recorded.</p>

<p>The following letter of his old commander, the celebrated
Indian fighter, Gen. E.&nbsp;A. Carr, written years ago relative to
him, is a tribute as generous as any brave man has ever made
to another:</p>

<p>“From his services in my command, steadily in the field, I
am qualified to bear testimony as to his qualities and character.</p>

<p>“He was very modest and unassuming. He is a natural
gentleman in his manners as well as in character, and has
none of the roughness of the typical frontiersman. He can
take his own part when required, but I have never heard of
his using a knife or a pistol, or engaging in a quarrel where it
could be avoided. His personal strength and activity are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
great, and his temper and disposition are so good that no one
has reason to quarrel with him.</p>

<p>“His eyesight is better than a good field-glass; he is the
best trailer I ever heard of, and also the best judge of the
‘lay of country’&mdash;that is, he is able to tell what kind of
country is ahead, so as to know how to act. He is a perfect
judge of distance, and always ready to tell correctly how many
miles it is to water, or to any place, or how many miles have
been marched....</p>

<p>“Mr. Cody seemed never to tire, and was always ready to
go in the darkest night or the worst weather, and usually volunteered,
knowing what the emergency required. His trailing,
when following Indians, or looking for stray animals, or
for game, is simply wonderful. He is a most extraordinary
hunter.</p>

<p>“In a fight, Mr. Cody is never noisy, obstreperous, or
excited. In fact, I hardly ever noticed him in a fight unless
I happened to want him, or he had something to report, when
he was always in the right place, and his information was
always valuable and reliable.</p>

<p>“During the winter of 1868 we encountered hardships and
exposure in terrific snow-storms and sleet. On one occasion
that winter Mr. Cody showed his quality by quietly offering
to go with some dispatches to General Sheridan across a dangerous
region of 300 miles where other principal scouts were
reluctant to risk themselves.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cody has since served with me as post guide and
scout at Fort McPherson, where he frequently distinguished
himself.</p>

<p>“In the summer of 1876 Cody went with me to the Black
Hills region, where he killed Yellow Hand. Afterward he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
was with the Big Horn and Yellowstone expedition. I consider
that his services to the country and the army by trailing,
finding, and fighting Indians, and thus protecting the frontier
settlers, and by guiding commands over the best and most
practicable routes, have been invaluable.”</p>

  <div class="caption">DANGER AHEAD.</div></div>

<p>Thus it will be seen that notwithstanding it will sometimes
be thought his fame rests upon the pen of the romancer,
had they never been attracted to him&mdash;and they were solely by
his sterling worth&mdash;W.&nbsp;F. Cody would none the less have been
a remarkable character in American history.</p>

<p>The history of such a man, attractive as it has already been
to the most distinguished officers and fighters in the United
States Army, must prove doubly so to men, women, and
children who have heretofore found only in novels the hero of
rare exploits, on which imagination so loves to dwell.</p>

<p>As a proof that our great military leaders and the officers
of the United States Army recognize the value of Buffalo Bill
as a scout, guide, and Indian fighter, and that though I am
writing of one of whom more stories of romance have been
written than of any other individual living or dead, it will be
well to turn to the letters of commendation from prominent
personages in another part of this book, and the quotations
which are given in this chapter from such authorities as General
Sheridan’s “Autobiography,” Captain Price’s “Across the
Continent with the Fifth Cavalry,” Colonel Dodge’s “Thirty
Years Among the Indians,” etc.</p>

<p>These indorsements stamp Buffalo Bill as one whose deeds
speak for themselves, and show conclusively that he is not a
pen-made man, but worthy of all said and written of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<h3 class="b0">ACROSS THE CONTINENT WITH THE FIFTH CAVALRY.</h3>

<p class="p0 center b1">(Capt. George F. Price.)</p>

<p>“After Cody was appointed chief scout and guide for the
Republican River expedition, he was conspicuous during the
pursuit of the Dog Soldiers, under the celebrated Cheyenne
chief, Tall Bull, whom he killed at Summit Springs, Colo.
He also guided the Fifth Cavalry to a position whence the
regiment was enabled to charge upon the enemy and win a
brilliant victory. He afterward participated in the Niobrara
pursuit, and later narrowly escaped death at the hands of hostile
Sioux on Prairie Dog Creek, Kan., September 26, 1869.
He was assigned to Fort McPherson when the expedition was
disbanded, and served at that station (was a justice of the
peace in 1871) until the Fifth Cavalry was transferred to Arizona.
He served during this period with several expeditions,
and was conspicuous for gallant conduct in the Indian combat
at Red Willow and Birdwood creeks, and also for successful
services as chief scout and guide of the buffalo-hunt which
was arranged by General Sheridan for the Grand Duke Alexis
of Russia.</p>

<p>“Cody was then assigned to duty with the Third Cavalry,
and served with that regiment until the fall of 1872, when he
was elected a member of the Nebraska Legislature, and thus
acquired the title of ‘Honorable.’</p>

<p>“At the beginning of the Sioux War in 1876 he hastened to
Cheyenne, Wyo., joined the Fifth Cavalry, which had recently
returned from Arizona, and was engaged in the affair at War
Bonnet (Indian Creek), Wyo. He then accompanied the Fifth
Cavalry to Goose Creek, Mont., and served with the Big Horn
and Yellowstone expedition until September. Cody abundantly
proved during this campaign that he had lost none of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
his old-time skill and daring in Indian warfare. He enjoys a
brilliant reputation as a scout and guide, which has been
fairly earned by faithful and conspicuous service.</p>

<p>“William F. Cody is one of the best scouts and guides that
ever rode at the head of a column of cavalry on the prairies
of the Far West. His army friends, from general to private,
hope that he may live long and prosper abundantly.</p>

<p>“Should the wild Sioux again go on the war-path, Cody, if
living, will be found with the cavalry advance, riding another
‘Buckskin Joe,’ and carrying his Springfield rifle, ‘Lucretia,’
across the pommel of his saddle.”</p>

<p>This merited note of applause will find an echo in every
patriotic American heart which recognizes and remembers
that it was in the Fifth Cavalry that Gens. Robert E. Lee,
Albert Sidney Johnston, Hardee, Emory, Van Dorn, Custer,
and other noted generals served, and which was formerly
known as the Second Dragoons.</p>

  <div class="caption">GUIDING IN A BLIZZARD.</div></div>

<p>From Gen. Phil Sheridan’s “Autobiography.” After relating
his conception of the <i>first winter campaign</i> against
Indians on the then uninhabited and bleak plains, in the
winter of 1868, he says:</p>

<p>“The difficulties and hardships to be encountered had
led several experienced officers of the army and some frontiersmen,
like old Jim Bridger, the famous scout and guide of
earlier days, to discourage the project. I decided to go in
person, bent on showing the Indians that they were not secure
from punishment because of inclement weather&mdash;an ally on
which they had hitherto relied with much assurance. We
started, and the very first night a blizzard struck us and carried
away our tents. The gale was so violent that they could
not be put up again; the rain and snow drenched us to the skin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Shivering from <i>wet and cold, I took refuge under a wagon</i>, and
there spent such a miserable night that when morning came
the gloomy predictions of old man Bridger and others rose up
before me with greatly increased force. The difficulties were
now fully realized; the blinding snow, mixed with sleet; the
piercing wind, thermometer below zero&mdash;with green bushes
only for fuel&mdash;occasioning intense suffering. Our numbers
and companionship alone prevented us from being lost or perishing,
a fate that stared in the face the frontiersmen, guides,
and scouts on their solitary missions.</p>

<p>“An important matter had been to secure competent guides
for the different columns of troops, for, as I have said, the
section of <i>country to be operated in was comparatively unknown</i>.</p>

<p>“In those days the railroad town of Hays City was filled
with so-called ‘Indian scouts,’ whose common boast was of
having slain scores of redskins; but the real scout&mdash;that is, a
guide and trailer knowing the habits of the Indians&mdash;was very
scarce, and it was hard to find anybody familiar with the
country south of the Arkansas, where the campaign was to be
made. Still, about the various military posts there was some
good material to select from, and we managed to employ
several men, who, from their experience on the plains in various
capacities, or from natural instinct and aptitude, soon
became excellent guides and courageous and valuable scouts,
some of them, indeed, gaining much distinction. Mr. William
F. Cody (‘Buffalo Bill’), whose renown has since become
world-wide, was one of the men thus selected. He received
his sobriquet from his marked success in killing buffaloes to
supply fresh meat to the construction parties on the Kansas
Pacific Railway. He had lived from boyhood on the plains and
passed every experience&mdash;herder, hunter, pony-express rider,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
stage-driver, wagon-master in the quartermaster’s department,
and scout of the army, and was first brought to my notice by
distinguishing himself in bringing me an important dispatch
from Fort Larned to Fort Hays, a distance of sixty-five miles,
through a section infested with Indians. The dispatch
informed me that the Indians near Larned were preparing to
decamp, and this intelligence required that certain orders
should be carried to Fort Dodge, ninety-five miles south of
Hays. This too being a particularly dangerous route&mdash;several
couriers having been killed on it&mdash;it was impossible to get
one of the various Petes, Jacks, or Jims hanging around
Hays City to take my communication. Cody, learning of the
strait I was in, manfully came to the rescue, and proposed to
make the trip to Dodge, though he had just finished his long
and perilous ride from Larned. I gratefully accepted his
offer, and after a short rest he mounted a fresh horse and
hastened on his journey, halting but once to rest on the way,
and then only for an hour, the stop being made at Coon
Creek, where he got another mount from a troop of cavalry.
At Dodge he took some sleep, and then continued on to his own
post&mdash;Fort Larned&mdash;with more dispatches. After resting at
Larned he was again in the saddle with tidings for me at Fort
Hays, General Hazen sending him this time with word that
the villages had fled to the south of the Arkansas. Thus, in
all, Cody rode about three hundred and fifty miles in less than
sixty hours, and such an exhibition of endurance and courage at
that time of the year and in such weather was more than
enough to convince me that his services would be extremely
valuable in the campaign, so I retained him at Fort Hays
till the battalion of the Fifth Cavalry arrived, and then made
him chief of scouts.”</p>

  <div class="caption">BUFFALO BILL AS BUFFALO HUNTER.</div></div>

<p>Read through the fascinating book, “Campaigning with
Crook (Maj.-Gen. George Crook, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A.) and Stories of
Army Life,” due to the graphic and soldierly pen of Capt.
Charles King of the United States Army, published in 1890.</p>

<p>Incidentally the author refers in various pages to Colonel
Cody as scout, etc., and testifies to the general esteem and
affection in which Buffalo Bill is held by the army.</p>

<p>The subjoined extracts from the book will give our readers
an excellent idea of the military scout’s calling and its
dangers:</p>

<p>“‘By Jove! General,’ says Buffalo Bill, sliding backward
down the hill, ‘now’s our chance. Let our party mount here
out of sight and we’ll cut those fellows off. Come down,
every other man of you.’</p>

<p>“Glancing behind me, I see Cody, Tait, and ‘Chips,’ with
five cavalrymen, eagerly bending forward in their saddles,
grasping carbine and rifle, every eye bent upon me, watching
for the signal. Not a man but myself knows how near they
are. ‘That’s right, close in, you beggars! Ten seconds more
and you are on them! A hundred and twenty-five yards&mdash;a
hundred&mdash;ninety&mdash;now, lads, in with you.’...</p>

<p>“There’s a rush, a wild ringing cheer; then bang, bang,
bang! and in a cloud of dust, Cody and his men tumble in
among them, Buffalo Bill closing on a superbly accoutered
warrior. It is the work of a minute; the Indian has fired and
missed. Cody’s bullet tears through the rider’s leg into the
pony’s heart, and they tumble in a confused heap on the prairie.
The Cheyenne struggles to his feet for another shot, but
Cody’s second bullet hits the mark. It is now close quarters,
knife to knife. After a hand-to-hand struggle, Cody wins,
and the young chief Yellow Hand drops lifeless in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
tracks after a hot fight. Baffled and astounded, for once in a
lifetime beaten at their own game, their project of joining
Sitting Bull nipped in the bud, they take hurried flight.
But our chief is satisfied; Buffalo Bill is radiant; his are
the honors of the day.”&mdash;<i>From p. 35.</i></p>

  <div class="caption">BUFFALO BILL’S DUEL WITH CHIEF YELLOW HAND.</div></div>

<p>General Cody holds his commission in the National
Guard of the United States (State of Nebraska), an honorable
position, and as high as he can possibly attain. <i>His connection
with the Regular United States Army</i> has covered a continuous
period of <i>fifteen years</i>, and desultory connection of
thirty years&mdash;in the most troublous era of that superb corps’
Western history&mdash;as guide, scout, and chief of scouts&mdash;a position
unknown in any other service, and the confidential
nature of which is told in the extract from General Dodge’s
work, quoted below. This privileged position, and the nature
of its services in the past, may be more fully appreciated
when it is understood that it commanded, besides horses, subsistence,
and quarters, $10 per day ($3,650 per year), all
expenses, and for special service, or “life and death” volunteer
missions, special rewards of from $100 to $500 for carrying
a single dispatch, and brought its holder the confidence
of commanding generals, the fraternal friendship of the commissioned
officers, the idolization of the ranks, and the universal
respect and consideration of the hardy pioneers and
settlers of the West.</p>

<p>In addition to the distinguished officers previously named
in this chapter, General Cody may also well be proud of his
service under Generals Bankhead, Fry, Crittenden, Switzer,
Rucker, Smith, King, Van Vliet, Anson, Mills, Reynolds,
Greeley, Penrose, Sandy, Forsyth, Dudley, Canby, Blunt,
Hayes, Guy, Henry, and others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
As a fitting close to this chapter of Cody’s record as a
scout, and as epitomizing the character of his services, the
writer quotes from page 628 of Colonel Dodge’s “Thirty
Years Among the Indians”:</p>

<p>“Of ten men employed as scouts, nine will prove to be
worthless; of fifty so employed, one may prove to be really valuable;
but though hundreds, even thousands, of men have been
so employed by the Government since the war, the number
of really remarkable men among them can be counted on the
fingers. The services which these men are called on to perform
are so important and valuable that the officer who
benefits by them is sure to give the fullest credit, and men
honored in official reports come to be great men on the frontier.
Fremont’s reports made Kit Carson a renowned man.
Custer immortalized California Joe. Custer, Merritt, Carr,
and Miles made William F. Cody (‘Buffalo Bill’) a plains
celebrity ‘<i>until time shall be no more</i>’.”</p>

<span class="subhead">WHAT IS A COWBOY?</span></h2>

<p>Around the name of cowboy hangs a romance that will
never die.</p>

<p>It is a romance interwoven with deeds of daring, nerve, and
big-heartedness that will survive long after civilization has
stamped out every need for the brave men who have been
known by the name of cowboy.</p>

  <div class="caption">COWBOYS LASSOING WILD HORSES.</div></div>

<p>Our country is one that has sprung surprises upon the world
from its very beginning, and it has produced men possible in
no other land.</p>

<p>Without the services of the cowboy the vast grazing-lands
of America would have been worthless.</p>

<p>As the buffalo, like the Indian, perished before the march
of emigration westward, there came to take their place vast
herds of beef-cattle, feeding on the plains where the once wild
monarchs of the prairies had roamed.</p>

<p>With these immense herds it was necessary to have herders,
and they became known by the somewhat picturesque
cognomen of cowboy.</p>

<p>They are known from the flower-bespangled prairies of
the Lone Star State to the land of the Frozen North, and
their worth is recognized by those who know them as they
are, for to their care is given the vast wealth of the cattlemen
of the country, which is not alone in the beef furnished
for the markets but to be found also in the tan-yards and
factories of the East.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
By many, who do not know him as he is, the cowboy is
despised and generally feared.</p>

<p>He is looked upon as a wild, reckless fellow, armed to the
teeth, keeping half-full of bad whisky, and always ready for a
fight or some deed of deviltry.</p>

<p>How little is he known, and thus abused, for no braver
hearts, no more generous motives, are to be found among men
than are those that beat beneath the hunting-shirt of the cowboy,
whether he comes from the country bordering on the Rio
Grande, the great plains of the Southwest, the level prairies
of the West, or the grazing-lands of Wyoming.</p>

<p>During night and day, storm and sunshine, danger and
death, they are at their post of duty, always ready to be called
upon, shrinking from no hardship, driven off by no peril, suffering
untold privations, but ever ready to protect and care
for the valuable herds that they control.</p>

<p>At times, when a temporary relief from duty comes to
them, is it a wonder that they break forth into reckless
hilarity?</p>

<p>They mean no harm to any one, and if, as in all communities,
one goes beyond all bounds and the death of a comrade
follows, the many must suffer for the deeds of the few.</p>

<p>The cowboy is composed of that stern stuff of which heroes
are made, and the poet and the novelist have always found
in this rover of the plains the richest material for song and
story.</p>

<p>In olden times it was that the boys of every land turned
toward the sea as the Mecca of their hopes and ambitions.</p>

<p>They saw upon its broad bosom a field of adventure, a life
of romance; and they sought to emulate great captains, good
and bad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
But with the coming of steam-vessels the romance of the
seas faded into oblivion; foreign lands were brought near; the
mystery of the blue waters was solved in a most matter-of-fact
way, and the growing youths of the country turned to new
fields of adventure.</p>

<p>Columbus had won the admiration of would-be young
heroes, and the heroic deeds of the grand old sailor were read
with avidity, the boy longing some day to emulate them.</p>

<p>Even Kyd, Lafitte, Morgan, and other pirate captains
became heroes in the minds of the average boy, who longed to
run away to sea and make his name known in the world.</p>

<p>But steam dispelled these ambitions, and the American
boy was forced to turn his hopes upon the land of the setting
sun.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone was a hero to admire; David Crockett, Kit
Carson, and others became the beau ideal of border heroes,
and the heart of the youth thrilled in reading of these men in
buckskin.</p>

<p>And these men of the wild West, of whom Buffalo Bill is
the most conspicuous figure, made it possible for other border
heroes to appear.</p>

<p>They sprung from the ranks of the army, from the emigrant’s
cabin, and from among those rangers of the plains, the
cowboys.</p>

<p>These brave fellows have produced many a hero in their
ranks, and they have been ever ready to battle for the weak
against the strong.</p>

<p>The ranch and the cattle interests are being encroached
upon by the advance of civilization, the mask of mystery
is being torn from the wild borderland by the westward
march of the iron horse, and in a few more years, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
scout, the guide, the trapper, and the hunter, the cowboy will
be a thing of the past.</p>

<div id="ip_40" class="figcenter" style="width: 331px;">

  <div class="caption">A BUCKING BRONCO.</div></div>

<p>To be acknowledged as a true cowboy, and to the prairie
born, one must possess accomplishments for the perilous and
arduous work they have to undergo.</p>

<p>He must be a perfect horseman, handle a rope, catch a
calf, throw and tie a steer, stop a crazy cow on a stampede,
lasso a mustang, and be a good shot, guide, scout, and Indian
fighter as well.</p>

<p>Let me here refer to a few incidents of a trip over the
plains of a herd of cattle to the markets of the North, through
the wild and unsettled portions of the Territories, varying in
distance from fifteen hundred to two thousand miles, time
three to six months, extending through the Indian Territory
and Kansas to Nebraska, Colorado, Dakota, Montana, Idaho,
Nevada, and sometimes as far as California. Immense herds,
as high as thirty thousand or more, are moved by single
owners, but are driven in bands of from one to three thousand,
which, when under way, are designated “herds.” Each of
these have from ten to fifteen men, with a wagon-driver and
cook, and the “king-pin of the outfit,” the boss, with a supply
of two or three ponies to a man, an ox-team, and blankets;
also jerked-beef and corn-meal&mdash;the staple food. They are
also furnished with mavericks, or “doubtless-owned” yearlings,
for the fresh-meat supply. After getting fully under
way, and the cattle broke in, from ten to fifteen miles a
day is the average, and everything is plain sailing in fair
weather. As night comes on the cattle are rounded up in a
small compass, and held until they lie down, when two men
are left on watch, riding round and round them in opposite
directions, singing or whistling all the time, for two hours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
that being the length of each watch. The singing is absolutely
necessary, as it seems to soothe the fears of the cattle,
scares away the wolves or other varmints that may be prowling
around, and prevents them from hearing any other accidental
sound, or dreaming of their old homes; and if stopped
would in all probability be the signal for a general stampede.
“Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast,” if a cowboy’s
compulsory bawling out lines of his own composition:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lie nicely now, cattle, don’t heed any rattle,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">But quietly rest until morn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if you skedaddle, we’ll jump in the saddle,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And head you as sure as you’re born,<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">can be considered such.</p>

<p>Ordinarily so clumsy and stupid-looking, a thousand beef-steers
can rise like a flock of quail on the roof of an exploding
powder-mill, and will scud away like a tumble-weed before a
high wind, with a noise like a receding earthquake. Then
comes fun and frolic for the boys. Many a cowboy has lost
his life in one of these wild stampedes of cattle, which would
put an army of men to flight in a mad charge down upon them.</p>

<div id="ip_41" class="figcenter" style="width: 474px;">
  <img src="images/i_042.jpg" width="474" height="279" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">A CATTLE STAMPEDE.</div></div>

<p>The next great trouble is in crossing streams, which are
invariably high in the driving season. When cattle strike
swimming-water, they generally try to turn back, which eventuates
in their “milling”&mdash;that is, swimming in a circle&mdash;and if
allowed to continue would result in the drowning of many.
Then the daring herder must leave his pony, doff his togs,
scramble over their backs and horns, to scatter them, and with
whoops and yells, splashing, dashing, and didos in the water,
scare them to the opposite bank. This is not always done in a
moment, for a steer is no fool of a swimmer. One has been
seen to hold his own for six hours in the gulf, after having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
jumped overboard. As some of the streams are very rapid,
and a quarter to a half mile wide, considerable drifting is done.
Then the naked herder has plenty of amusement in the hot
sun, fighting green-head flies and mosquitoes, and peeping
around for Indians, until the rest of the lay-out is put over&mdash;not
an easy job. A temporary boat has to be made of the
wagon-box by tacking the canvas cover over the bottom,
with which the ammunition and grub is ferried across, and
the running-gear and ponies are swum over afterward. Indian
fights and horse-thief troubles are part of the regular rations.
Mixing with other herds and cutting them out, again avoiding
too much water at times and hunting for a drop at others,
belongs to the regular routine.</p>

<p>Such is the cowboy of the wild West, who, if not without
faults, has virtues to compensate for the little eccentricities
that cling to men of the frontier.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE RIDERS OF THE WORLD.</span></h2>

<p>Many customs and habits, by reason of their peculiar surroundings
and requirements, have become necessities, and,
indeed, second nature to some people; while to others, whose
observation has shown the graces and beauties of these same
customs and habits, they are studied with great diligence and
application, and acquired, as far as such things can be acquired,
as accomplishments.</p>

<p>To the Bedouin of the Arabian Desert, the Cossack, the
Vacquero, the Gaucho, and last, but the peers of any of these,
our native Indian and our own cowboy, the horse is a necessity;
and woe be unto that man who by fraud, stealth, or force
attempts to despoil the owner of his animal, his pet. Pleasures,
comforts, necessities, aye, living itself, would be impossible
to either of these if his horse was not part of his worldly
possessions. The desert, the pampas, the llanos, and the
prairie without horses would, for the uses of man, be as an
ocean without ships or boats. But to the fashionables of the
world the art of horsemanship is a beautiful and admirable
accomplishment, a means of healthful exercise. The rider’s
grace of carriage, his easy seat, his courageous bearing, like
the fit of his handsome tailor-made riding-suit, are objects of
pride to himself, and causes of congratulation from his
associates. Gentlemen riders occasionally replace their
jockeys on the race-course for the display of their grace
and ability. But, after all, how poor their best efforts seem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
how awkward their most graceful carriage, and how uncertain
and timid their most heroic riding appears when put in actual
contrast to the native ease, grace, daring, and picturesque
riding of those “to the manor born.” The one is, to quote
from familiar slang, “born in the saddle,” “looks as if part of
his horse,” while the other easily betrays his hours of study
and of practice.</p>

<p>As children we have all read of the Arab, but we remember
him principally by recollecting his love for his horse.
From our school-boy days the Arab and his horse have been
as one to us. His somewhat fantastic costume and the complicated
trappings of his steed were beautiful pictures to us,
and we recall them yet. These Bedouins of the Arabian
Desert are not only recognized as among the best horsemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
of the world, but are the beau ideal of Eastern pathfinders.
The Cossack of the Caucasian line is by inheritance and
inclination among the most fearless and graceful horsemen of
the world. His system of warfare, which bears a striking
similarity to that which prevailed on the American frontier a
few years ago, is the finest school for the development of
military horsemanship since the days of Saladin and Cœur
de Leon. The Cossacks of the Caucasian line are entitled
to be called the flower of that great horde of irregular cavalry,
the Cossack Military Colonies, that dwell along the southern
frontier of the Russian Empire. They spring from the same
branch of the great Cossack family, the Zaporogians, which
Byron immortalized in his great poem “Mazeppa.” On their
light steppe horses, which are as fierce and active as themselves,
they have proven themselves worthy of their fierce and
warlike sires. Experts as swordsmen, as well as horsemen,
they met their old enemies, the Russians, on equal terms.</p>

<p>As picturesque, and more gaudy in appearance and trapping
than either the Bedouin or the Cossack, is the wily Vacquero
of our neighboring Mexico. Agile, hardy, and dashing,
adepts in the work of lasso-throwing, as well as with arms,
they are alike interesting in exhibition and dangerous as
foes.</p>

<p>But of all these native-born and wonderful horsemen of
lands other than our own, perhaps the most complete, the
most daring and dangerous in war, the most phenomenal
trailer, the greatest pathfinder, is the wonderful Gaucho from
the llanos of the Argentine Republic. From his earliest
infancy the half-wild horses have been his intimates and
familiars. When the American or English boy is just learning
to stand on his feet alone, the infant Gaucho is being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
taught by his fond mother to steady himself on the back of
one of the ponies of the herd. At the age of four years he can
ride the wildest colt that roams the pampas, and from that time
he and his horse are practically one; and to unseat him would be
almost to tear from the horse a portion of his own anatomy.
He is by virtue of his home life and occupations completely
dependent on his horse. He spends most of his life on horseback,
and is associated with the wild equine to a greater
degree than any member of the other equestrian races of the
world. Armed with the deadly bolas he is a terrible foe to
either bird, beast, or man. The bolas consists of a number
of rawhide thongs fastened to a central thong and with an
iron ball at each of the ends. He is possibly the most expert
lassoer in the world; and when in pursuit of animal or bird he
hurls the deadly bolas with unerring skill. From a distance
of sixty feet he causes it to inextricably entangle about the
legs, bringing the victim helpless to the ground. When tracking
his foe across the pathless continent, his fearful skill and
persistence make the work of the Cuban bloodhound and
the Bedouin of the desert appear like child’s play. It is
interesting to note that the Gaucho himself makes nearly
everything connected with his outfit, from the saddle in
which he rides to the boots which cover his feet.</p>

  <div class="caption">WILD RIDERS OF THE PLAINS.</div></div>

<p>Though these horsemen of the Orient and of South America
are picturesque types of the riders of the world, the list would
indeed be incomplete if we omitted our own Indian and
cowboy. To the former no price is too high, no danger too
threatening to risk, no undertaking too hazardous to attempt,
that will win for him a horse. His wealth is told in the number
of his horses, and while he may keep his promise of peace
to the settler, he can rarely resist “borrowing” one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
horses if occasion seems to him to demand the need of it.
Whether in pursuit of game, indulging in his peculiarly interesting
sports, or on the war-path, his pony is his friend and
companion. It would at times appear as though the wish, the
thought, of the rider was in some mysterious way communicated
to the horse without word of mouth or touch of bridle-rein,
so quick are their changes of movement or direction and
so seldom is a correction made.</p>

<p>Indian warfare was made far more dangerous to the
pioneer of comparatively later days by reason of the red
man’s introduction to the horse. In the earliest conflicts
between the hereditary owners of this continent and the white
aggressor, the horse and his uses were unknown to the former.
His fighting, like his hunting, had to be done on foot. An
Indian attack in those days could not be made with the suddenness
or the rush, nor could his retreat be so quickly
accomplished, as in after years. And it was not until Cortez
brought over his horses that the “long-felt want” was satisfied.
Now, like a veritable Centaur, he strides his animal, his
command so complete that it appears his arms and hands are
not needed for use in his horsemanship, but left free to handle
his bow and arrow or his rifle.</p>

<p>Just here it may be well to say a few words relative to the
noble animal whose duties and services have commanded the
admiration of mankind.</p>

<p>It seems to be a settled fact that the horse is of Moorish
origin, as also is his accompaniment, the saddle.</p>

<p>To follow the theory of other able writers, the horse is
thought to be a native of the plains of Central Asia, but the
wild species from which it is derived is not certainly known.
The Asiatic horse with its one digit was in turn evolved from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
ancestors with polydactyl feet. Some instances have been
known in modern times, and ancient records give stories, of
horses presenting more than one toe. Julius Cæsar’s horse
is said to have had this peculiarity. Suetonius, the writer,
describes this horse as being almost human, with the hoofs
cleft like toes. This author says: “It was born in Cæsar’s
own stables, and as the soothsayers declared that it showed
that its owner would be lord of the world, he reared it with
great care, and was the first to mount it. It would allow no
other rider.” Most of the polydactyl horses found in the
present day have been raised in the southwest of America,
or from that ancestry bred. In this way their connection
with the mustang, or semi-wild stock of that region, becomes
at least probable.</p>

<p>This same raw-boned, small, or medium-sized horse, called
the mustang, possesses a well-authenticated claim to noble
origin. Horses of good Berber blood were brought over by
the Spanish conquerors under Cortez and De Soto, and it is a
most reasonable supposition that these invaders selected the
very best and strongest specimens of the breed for use in their
daring ventures. It is not surprising that the natives of Mexico,
when for the first time they saw approaching them men
on horses, both clad in glittering armor, were filled with terror.
To them it seemed that man and horse were one, a veritable
four-legged warrior, and they fled precipitately to the fastnesses
of their own mountains to escape contact with this
monstrosity.</p>

<p>In good time the climate and surroundings wrought many
changes in the horse that first landed on the shores of Mexico,
and the breed eventually became what is now known as the
“American mustang,” perhaps the hardiest specimen of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
genus horse now known. From this origin evoluted the
finest breeds of horses now claimed to be American bred.</p>

<p>During the visit of the Wild West to Paris, General Cody,
by invitation, called on Rosa Bonheur, the famous painter of
horses. Three years prior to this time Miss Bonheur had
received from America three fine mustang ponies, two of which
had, despite all effort, remained uncontrollable and therefore,
of course, useless to her. These latter she generously tendered
to General Cody as a present. Her surprise when Cody
calmly accepted the offer, and assured her that “his boys”
would have but little trouble in catching and controlling these
animals, can hardly be described. True to his assurance,
Cody soon had two of his “boys” on hand, and in a short
time the apparently uncontrollable “Appach” and “Clair de
Lune” were lassoed by the “boys,” saddled and mounted.
This scene was witnessed not only by the great artist herself
but by numbers of marveling neighbors, who, by peeping
through their window-shutters, saw for the first time a lasso
hunt. The quick, accurate, and successful work of the American
cowboy astonished and interested all these witnesses to a
wonderful degree.</p>

<p>To the cowboy’s dexterous horsemanship, added to his
courage and endurance, has been largely due the protection
of the lives and property of the early emigrants to the great
West. For years the dissemination of news was entirely
dependent upon these heroic riders. Now the success and
preservation of the vast cattle interests are made possible
only by the watchful care of the cowboy and his pony&mdash;the
one practically helpless without the other.</p>

<p>The “view halloo” of the English hunting gentleman may
be inspiriting to those accustomed to it, but how it lacks in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
vigor, in earnestness, in actual music, the famous cowboy yell
as he and his pony dash upon game or hostile Indians. This
latter carries with its sound the conviction of heartiness,
determination, and enthusiasm with which he begins a sport,
faces a danger, or encounters a foe. To those who have seen
Gen. W.&nbsp;F. Cody (“Buffalo Bill”) give exhibitions of this
method of riding, it will readily be understood how difficult it
is in words to illustrate the strange peculiarity of its singular
attractiveness.</p>

<p>To this man of ideas is due the thought of gathering
together in one congress the representatives of all these types
of horses and riders. And, as with Cody to resolve is to act,
this interesting assemblage is ready for public contemplation
at the World’s Fair.</p>

<p>It may not be inappropriate in this chapter to quote the
words of the famous king of poets in eulogy of that noble
animal, the horse.</p>

<h3>BUFFALO BILL’S EQUINE HEROES.</h3>

<p>Mr. Cody is a great lover of man’s best friend among the
animal kingdom&mdash;the horse. The peculiar career he has followed
has made his equine friend such a sterling necessity as a
companion, an assistant, a confidant, that he admits, as every
frontiersman and scout does, a great deal depends, even life
itself in innumerable emergencies, on the general sagacity of
this noble brute. For the purposes of the trail, the hunt, the
battle, the pursuit, or the stampede it was essentially necessary
to select, for chargers with which to gain success, animals
excelling in the qualities of strength, speed, docility, courage,
stamina, keen scent, delicacy of ear, quick of sight, sure-footed,
shrewd in perception, nobleness of character, and general
intelligence. History records, and a grateful memory still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
holds dear, numberless famous quadruped allies that Buffalo
Bill has during his long career possessed, and many are the
stories told on the frontier and in the army of Old Buckskin
Joe, Brigham, Tall Bull, Powder-Face, Stranger, and Old
Charlie.</p>

<div id="ip_54" class="figcenter" style="width: 276px;">
  <img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="276" height="192" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">COMRADES.</div></div>

<p>Old Buckskin Joe was one of his early favorites, who by
long service in army-scouting became quite an adept, and
seemed to have a perfect knowledge of the duties required of
him. For this reason, when ordered to find and report the
location of the savages in their strongholds, at times hundreds
of miles away over a lonely country, infested by scouting
parties of hostiles liable at any instant to pounce upon one,
Old Buckskin was always selected by Cody to accompany
him on the trail when the work was dangerous. Mounted on
another horse, he would let Buckskin follow untrammeled,
even by a halter, so as to reserve him fresh in case of discovery
and the terrible necessity of “a ride for life.” Quick
to scent danger, he instinctively gave evidence of his fears,
and would almost assist his saddling or quickly insert his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
in the bridle, and once on his back Joe was always able to bid
defiance to the swiftest horses the Indians possessed, and the
longer the chase the farther they were left in his rear. On
one occasion his master descried a band of 100 warriors,
who gave them chase from the headwaters of the Republican
River to Fort McPherson, a distance of 195 miles. It was
at a season when the ponies were in good condition, and the
savage band, though thirsting for the scalp of their well-known
foe, Pa-he-has-ka (the long-haired scout), dropped
behind until on the last fifty miles but fifteen of the fleetest
were in pursuit, Buckskin leaving them out of sight twenty
miles from the fort.</p>

<p>This ride, famed in army annals, caused Old Buckskin to
go blind, but the gratitude of his master was such that Joe
was kept and carefully attended to until his death, which
occurred a few years ago at Cody’s home, North Platte.
Buckskin was accorded a decent funeral, and a tombstone
erected over his remains inscribed “Old Buckskin Joe, the
horse that on several occasions saved the life of Buffalo Bill
by carrying him safely out of the range of Indian bullets.
Died of old age, 1882.”</p>

<p>Brigham was another celebrity of his race, and it was on
his back Mr. Cody clinched his undisputed title of “King
Buffalo-killer,” and added permanency to the name of Buffalo
Bill by killing <i>sixty-nine buffalo in one run</i>; and such was this
steed’s knowledge of hunting that game that he discarded
saddle and bridle while following the herd, killing the last
half while riding this renowned pet of the chase <i>bareback</i>.</p>

<p>Many other tried and true ones have enhanced his love for
their race, the last of the famous old-timers being owned and
ridden by him in his daily exhibitions with the Wild West,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
traversing the continent five times, traveling thousands of
miles, and never missing a performance. Old Charlie possessed
all the virtues that go to form a “noble horse.” Charlie
was broken in by Mr. Cody, and has never been ridden by any
one else (except Miss Arta Cody, an accomplished horse-woman),
and for many years has been the participant of all
his master’s skirmishes, expeditions, long rides, and hunts;
has been ridden over all kinds of rough country, prairie-dog
towns, mountain and plain; has never stumbled or fallen,
being beyond a doubt one of the surest-footed animals man
ever rode; and for endurance is a second Buckskin Joe, if not
better, on one occasion, in an emergency, having carried his
master over a prairie road <i>one hundred miles in nine hours and
forty-five minutes</i>, rider and trappings weighing 243 pounds.
Old Charlie’s great point was his wonderful intelligence,
which caused him to act in a manner as to almost lay claim
in his conduct to judiciousness. In the most lonely or unattractive
place, or in one of the most seductive to equine
rambles, when his master removed saddle and bridle, he
could trust Charlie to stay where he was left, wrap himself in
a blanket, take the saddle for a pillow, go to sleep contented,
knowing his faithful steed would be close at hand, or, after
browsing fully, would come and lie close beside him, sink into
slumber, with ear at tension, one eye open, and at the slightest
disturbance arouse him to meet the threatened danger. All
the Indians in the country, keen as he was to scent them,
intuitively as he dreaded them, could not make him leave, or
stampede him, until his owner was mounted, challenging in
this respect the instincts of the highest class of watch-dog.</p>

<p>He cared not how much load you put on his back, having
carried 500 pounds of buffalo-meat; would pull as much by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
tying a lariat to the pommel as an ordinary horse with a
collar; would hold the strongest buffalo or steer, but when a
harness was placed on his back and a collar round his neck
he would not pull an ounce, and if not soon relieved would
viciously resent the (to him) seeming degradation.</p>

<p>Alas! poor Charlie died while crossing the ocean on
the homeward-bound voyage, and was buried at sea with all
the honors that would have been shown to a human being.</p>

<p>In his death Buffalo Bill lost a friend he will never forget.</p>

<span class="subhead">INDIAN HOME LIFE.</span></h2>

<p>To Indians at peace, and with food in plenty, the winter
camp is their home. After the varying excitements, the successes
and vicissitudes, the constant labors of many months,
the prospect of the winter’s peace and rest, with its home life
and home pleasures, comes like a soothing balm to all.</p>

<p>To those of the warriors who have passed the age of passionate
excitements, this season brings the full enjoyment of
those pleasures and excitements yet left to them in life.
Their days are spent in gambling, their long winter evenings
in endless repetitions of stories of their wonderful performances
in days gone by, and their nights in the sound, sweet
sleep vouchsafed only to easy consciences.</p>

<div id="ip_59" class="figcenter" style="width: 302px;">
  <img src="images/i_058.jpg" width="302" height="432" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">A REDSKIN SCOUT.</div></div>

<p>The women also have a good time. No more taking
down and putting up the tepee; no more packing and unpacking
the ponies. To bring the wood and water, do the little
cooking, to attend to the ponies, and possibly to dress a few
skins is all the labor devolved upon them.</p>

<p>To the young of both sexes, whether married or single,
this season brings unending excitement and pleasure. Now
is the time for dances and feasts, for visits and frolics and
merry-making of all kinds, and for this time the “story-teller”
has prepared and rehearsed his most marvelous recitals.
Above all, it is the season for love-making; “love rules
the camp,” and now is woman’s opportunity.</p>

<p>Without literature, without music or painting as arts, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
further study of nature than is necessary for the safety of
the needs of their daily life, with no knowledge or care for
politics or finance or the thousand questions of social or
other science that disturb and perplex the minds of civilized
people, and with reasoning faculties little superior to instinct,
there is among Indians no such thing as conversation as we
understand it. There is plenty of talk, but no interchange of
ideas; no expression and comparison of views and beliefs,
except on the most commonplace topics. Half a dozen old
sages will be sitting around, quietly and gravely passing the
pipe, and apparently engaged in important discussion. Nine
times out of ten their talk is the merest camp tattle, or about
a stray horse or sick colt, or where one killed a deer or
another saw a buffalo-track. All serious questions of war and
chase are reserved for discussion in the council lodge.</p>

<p>During the pleasant months he has constantly the healthy
stimulus of active life; during the winter he is either in a
state of lethargy or of undue excitement. During the day,
in the winter season, the men gamble or sleep, the women
work or idle, as suits each; but the moment it gets dark everybody
is on the qui vive, ready for any fun that presents
itself. A few beats on a tom-tom bring all the inmates of the
neighboring lodges; a dance or gambling bout is soon inaugurated,
and oftentimes kept up until nearly morning.</p>

<p>The insufficiency and uncertainty of human happiness has
been the theme of eloquent writers of all ages. Every man’s
happiness is lodged in his own nature, and is, to a certain
extent at least, independent of his external circumstances
and surroundings. These primitive people demonstrate the
general correctness of this theory, for they are habitually and
universally happy people. They thoroughly enjoy the present,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
make no worry over the possibilities of the future, and
“never cry over spilled milk.” It may be argued that their
apparent happiness is only insensibility, the happiness of the
mere animal, whose animal desires are satisfied. It may be
so. I simply state facts, others may draw conclusions. The
Indian is proud, sensitive, quick-tempered, easily wounded,
easily excited; but though utterly unforgiving, he never broods.
This is the whole secret of his happiness.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the wives are mere property, the
domestic life of the Indian will bear comparison with that of
average civilized communities. The husband, as a rule, is
kind; ruling, but with no harshness. The wives are generally
faithful, obedient, and industrious. The children are spoiled,
and a nuisance to all red visitors. Fortunately the white
man, the “bugaboo” of their baby days, is yet such an object
of terror as to keep them at a respectful distance. Among
themselves the members of the family are perfectly easy and
unrestrained. It is extremely rare that there is any quarreling
among the women.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as nervousness in either sex. Living
in but the one room, they are from babyhood accustomed to
what would be unbearable annoyance to whites. The head of
the lodge comes back tired from a hunt, throws himself down
on a bed, and goes fast to sleep, though his two or three wives
chatter around and his children tumble all over him. Everybody
seems to do just as he or she pleases, and this seems no
annoyance to anybody else.</p>

<p>Unlike her civilized sister, the Indian woman, “in her hour
of greatest need,” does not need any one. She would be
shocked at the idea of having a man doctor. In pleasant
weather the expectant mother betakes herself to the seclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
of some thicket; in winter she goes to a tepee provided in
each band for the women. In a few hours she returns with a
baby in its cradle on her back, and goes about her usual
duties as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Preparations for war or the chase occupy such hours of the
winter encampment as the noble red man can spare from
gambling, love-making, and personal adornment.</p>

<p>Each Indian must make for himself everything which he
can not procure by barter, and the opportunities for barter of
the more common necessities are very few, the Indians not
having even yet conceived the idea of making any articles
for sale among themselves.</p>

<p>The saddle requires much time and care in its construction;
some Indians can never learn to make one; consequently this
is more an article of barter than anything commonly made by
Indians.</p>

<p>No single article varies so much in make and value as the
bridle. The bit is always purchased, and is of every pattern,
from the plain snaffle to the complicated contrivance of the
Mexicans. The bridle of one Indian may be a mere head-stall
of rawhide attached to the bit, but without frontlet or
throat-latch, and with reins of the same material, the whole
not worth a dollar; that of another may be so elaborated by
patient labor, and so garnished with silver, as to be worth a
hundred dollars.</p>

<p>The Southern Indians have learned from the Mexicans the
art of plaiting horse-hair, and much of their work is very
artistic and beautiful, besides being wonderfully serviceable.
A small smooth stick, one-fourth of an inch in diameter, is the
mold over which the hair is plaited. When finished, the stick
is withdrawn. The hair used is previously dyed of different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
colors, and it is so woven as to present pretty patterns. The
hair, not being very strong, is used for the head-stall; the
reins, which require strength, are plaited solid, but in the same
pattern, showing skill, taste, and fitness.</p>

<p>The name “lariat” (Spanish, <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">riata</i>) is applied by all frontiersmen
and Indians to the rope or cord used for picketing or
fastening their horses while grazing, and also to the thong
used for catching wild animals&mdash;the lasso. They are the same,
with a very great difference. The lasso may be used for
picketing a horse, but the rope with which a horse is ordinarily
picketed would never be of use as a lasso.</p>

<p>A good riata (lasso) requires a great deal of labor and
patient care. It is sometimes made of plaited hair from the
manes and tails of horses, but these are not common except
where wild horses are plentiful, one such riata requiring the
hair of not less than twenty animals. It is generally made of
rawhide of buffalo or domestic cattle, freed from hair, cut
into narrow strips, and plaited with infinite patience and care,
so as to be perfectly round and smooth. Such a riata, though
costing less money than that of hair, is infinitely superior. It is
smooth, round, heavy, runs easily and quickly to noose, and is
as strong as a cable. Those tribes, as the Ute, who are unable
to procure beef or buffalo skins, make beautiful lariats of thin
strips of buckskin plaited together; but as these are used only
for securing their horses they are usually plaited flat.</p>

<p>To make these articles is all that the male Indian finds to
do in his ordinary winter life. Without occupation, without literature,
without thought, how man can persuade himself to
continue to exist can be explained only on the hypothesis that
he is a natural “club man,” or a mere animal.</p>

<p>“From rosy morn to dewy eve” there is always work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
for the Indian woman. Fortunately for her the aboriginal
inhabitants have as yet discovered no means of making a
light sufficient to work by at night. It is true they beg or buy
a few candles from military posts or traders, but these are
sacredly preserved for dances and grand occasions.</p>

<p>But, slave as she is, I doubt if she could be forced to work
after dark even if she had light. Custom, which holds her in
so many inexorable bonds, comes to her aid in this case. In
every tribe night is the woman’s right, and no matter how
urgent the work which occupies her during the daylight,
the moment the dark comes she bedecks herself in her best
finery and stands at the door of the lodge, her ear strained
for the first beat of the tom-tom which summons her to where
she is then, for once, queen and ruler.</p>

<p>There was formerly one exception to this immunity from
night work, but it has gone with the buffalo. At the time of
the “great fall hunt” there was no rest nor excuse for her.
She must work at any and all hours. If the herds were moving,
the success of the hunt might depend on the rapidity with
which the women performed their work on a batch of dead
buffalo. These animals spoil very quickly if not disemboweled,
and though the hunters tried to regulate the daily kill
by the ability of the squaws to “clean up” after them, they
could, not in the nature of things, always do so.</p>

<p>When the buffalo was dead the man’s work was done; it
was woman’s work to skin and cut up the dead animal; and
oftentimes, when the men were exceptionally fortunate, the
women were obliged to work hard and fast all night long
before the task was finished.</p>

<p>The meat, cut as closely as possible from the bones, is tied
up in the skin, and packed to camp on the ponies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
The skin is spread, flesh side upward, on a level piece
of ground, small slits are cut in the edges, and it is tightly
stretched and fastened down by wooden pegs driven through
the slits into the ground. The meat is cut into thin flakes
and placed upon poles or scaffolds to dry in the sun.</p>

<p>All this work must be done, as it were, instantly, for if
the skin is allowed to dry unstretched it can never be made
use of as a robe, and the meat spoils if not “jerked” within a
few hours.</p>

<p>This lively work lasts but a few weeks, and is looked upon
by the workers themselves pretty much in the same way as
notable housewives look upon the early house-cleaning&mdash;very
disagreeable, but very enjoyable. The real work begins
when, the hunt being over, the band has gone into winter
quarters, for then must the women begin to utilize “the
crop.”</p>

<p>Some of the thickest bulls’ hides are placed to soak in
water in which is mixed wood ashes, or some natural alkali.
This takes the hair off. The skin is then cut into the required
shape and stretched on a form, on which it is allowed to dry,
when it not only retains its shape but becomes almost as
hard as iron. These boxes are of various shapes and sizes&mdash;some
made like huge pocket-books, others like trunks. All
are called “parfleche.”</p>

<p>As soon as these parfleches, or trunks, are ready for use,
the now thoroughly dried meat is pounded to powder between
two stones. About two inches of this powdered meat is
placed in the bottom of a parfleche and melted fat is lightly
poured over it. Then another layer of meat is served in the
same way, and so on until the trunk is full. It is kept hot until
the entire mass is thoroughly saturated. When cold, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
parfleches are closed and tightly tied up. The contents so
prepared will keep in good condition for several years. Probably
the best feature of the process is that nothing is lost, the
flesh of old and tough animals being, after this treatment, so
nearly as good as that of the young that few persons can tell
the difference. This is the true Indian bread, and is used as
bread when they have fresh meat. Boiled, it makes a soup
very nutritious. So long as the Indian has this dried meat and
pemmican he is entirely independent of all other food. Of
late years all the beef issued to the Indians on the reservations,
and not needed for immediate consumption, is treated
in this way.</p>

<p>The dressing of skins is the next work. The thickest hides
are put in soak of alkali for materials for making shields,
saddles, riatas, etc. Hides for making or repairing lodges
are treated in the same way, but after the hair has been
removed they are reduced in thickness, made pliable, and
most frequently soaked.</p>

<p>Deer, antelope, and other skins are beautifully prepared
for clothing, the hair being always removed. Some of these
skins are so worked down that they are almost as thin and
white as cotton cloth.</p>

<p>But all this is the mere commencement of the long and
patient labor which the loving wife bestows on the robe
which the husband is to use on dress occasions. The whole
inner surface is frequently covered with designs beautifully
worked with porcupine-quills, or grasses dyed in various colors.
Sometimes the embellishments are paintings. Many
elegant robes have taken a year to finish.</p>

<p>Every animal brought into the camp brings work for the
squaw. The buck comes in with a deer and drops it at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
door. The squaw skins it, cuts up and preserves the meat,
dresses the skin and fashions it into garments for some member
of the family. Until within a very few years the needle
was a piece of sharpened bone; the thread a fiber of sinew.
These are yet used in the ornamentation of robes, but almost
all the ordinary sewing is done with civilized appliances.</p>

<p>All Indians are excessively fond of bead-work, and not
only the clothing, moccasins, gun-covers, quivers, knife-sheaths,
and tobacco-pouches, but every little bag or ornament,
is covered with this work. Many of the designs are
pretty and artistic. In stringing the beads for this work an
ordinary needle is used; but in every case, except for articles
made for sale, the thread is sinew.</p>

<p>The life in the winter encampment has scarcely been
changed in any particular, but with the earliest spring come
evidences of activity, a desire to get away; not attributable, as
in the “good old time,” to plans of forays for scalps and plunder,
but to the desire of each head of a lodge or band to
reach, before any one else does, the particular spot on which
he has fixed for his location for the summer. No sooner has
he reached it than all hands, men, women, and children, fall to
work as if the whole thing were a delightful frolic.</p>

<p>The last five years, more than any twenty preceding them,
have convinced the wild Indians of the utter futility of their
warfare against the United States Government. One and all,
they are thoroughly whipped; and their contests, in the future,
will be the acts of predatory parties (for which the Indians at
large are no more responsible than is the Government of the
United States for the acts of highwaymen in the Black Hills,
or train-robbers in Missouri), or a deliberate determination of
the bands and tribes to die fighting rather than by the slow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
torture of starvation to which the Government condemns
them.</p>

<p>But the buffalo is gone; so also nearly all the other large
game on which the Indians depended for food. They are confined
to comparatively restricted reservations, and completely
surrounded by whites. They are more perfectly aware of the
stringency of their situation than any white man can possibly
be, for they daily feel its pressure.</p>

<p>With no chance of success in war, with no possibility of
providing food for themselves, they thoroughly comprehend
that their only hope for the future is in Government aid, grazing
cattle, and tilling the soil.</p>

<p>They do not like it, of course; it would be unnatural if
they did. They accept it as the dire alternative against starvation.</p>

<p>Basing arguments on the Indian contempt for work, many
men in and out of Congress talk eloquent nonsense of the
impossibility of ever bringing them to agricultural pursuits.
The average Indian has no more hatred of labor, as such,
than the average white man. Neither will labor unless an
object is to be attained. Both will labor rather than starve.
Heretofore the Indian could comfortably support himself in
his usual and preferred life without labor; and there being no
other incentive he would have only proved himself an idiot
had he worked without an object.</p>

<p>But now, with the abundant acres of land that his white
conquerors, with simple justice, have allotted to him in the
shape of reservations, with no opportunity to think of the
excitement, honor, and glory of battle, his life is changed.
He now finds that fences are to be made, ground broken up,
seed planted; and the peerless warrior, with “an eye like an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
eagle,” whose name a few short years ago was a terror and
whose swoop was destruction, must learn to handle the plow,
and follow, in fact, what he has often claimed in desire and
spirit to follow, “the white man’s road.”</p>

<span class="subhead">EXPERT SHOOTING.</span></h2>

<p>Every custom, vocation, or study that has for its object
the protection of home, self, or one’s just rights, the defense
of the weak or the protection of the innocent, is justly
denominated “manly,” and commands universal respect and
admiration. If such attributes or qualifications as a steady
nerve, a clear, penetrating gaze, and intensity and earnestness
of purpose, are combined with quickness of action and
courageous bearing, the admiration grows stronger and the
respect deeper.</p>

  <div class="caption">BREAKING GLASS BALLS AT FULL SPEED.</div></div>

<p>Years ago scarcely anybody save the professional duelist
would ever have thought of making an accomplishment of
rifle or pistol shooting, unless, like the enlisted soldier or the
dweller on the prairies, a practical knowledge of fire-arms and
their uses became an absolute necessity for self-protection or
the performance of duty. Yet now so-called “fancy shooting”
is considered rather a “fad,” and its aptest exponents
are objects of laudation and applause. The huntsman is no
longer a slayer of game and wild beasts as a means of subsistence
for himself and family, or for sale to neighbors or in the
public market. The elephant is now rarely killed for his
tusks, the tiger for his skin, or the buffalo (what few there
are left of this species) for his flesh. Now the “chase” is a
mere sport, like “hunting the covers” in Merrie England, and
men boast of their prowess as hunters much as they do of
their skill at billiards. Yet an expert with the rifle or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
pistol is an object of applause and admiration, and even the
more courageous of the fair sex love to try their skill at a
target. For a time the old pastime of archery was revived,
but, whether its difficulties or its present-day impracticability
was the cause, it has been abandoned by the fashionable
world, and shooting-galleries are now the “thing” rather
than archery clubs.</p>

<p>In the march of progress the club, the lance, the javelin,
and the long-bow have been thrown aside, and modern invention
has given us the cannon, the shotgun, the musket, the
rifle, and the pistol. Some writers have even argued, and
ably too, that the invention of gunpowder had a most powerful
and active effect upon the civilization of the world.</p>

<p>However, the acts of aiming and discharging the projectile,
and successfully striking the target, be it animate or
inanimate, possess a rare fascination for the world at large.
What boy has not enjoyed raptures of delight at the story of
William Tell, and the fact of his having shot the apple from
his son’s head has made a more lingering and lasting impression
upon the readers of the story than his struggle to liberate
his countrymen from the tyranny personified in Gessler; and
you iconoclasts give mortal offense to the youth of the world
when you dare assert that their hero of Switzerland is a myth.
There is no story more interesting, told to the good little boy
who regularly attends his Sunday-school, than that of David’s
wonderful marksmanship when, by throwing a pebble from a
sling, he struck the mighty Goliath and slew him. David’s
after-history, his glories and his sacerdotal power, though
ofttimes told the youthful Biblical scholar and repeated to him
in sermons when he grows older, may have an effect, but still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
it is the incident of David’s meeting with the giant and his
victory over him that most surely impresses him.</p>

<p>To learn the science of accurate shooting by constant
practice in a gallery especially prepared for that purpose, the
target being inanimate and incapable of retaliation, may, and
often does, result in aptitude with the revolver and the rifle.
To preserve this cleverness, however, the conditions must always
be the same. The proper light must fall correctly upon
the target; nothing to disturb the serenity of the surroundings
or to distract the attention of the shooter must be permitted.</p>

<p>A grade higher comes the hunter. His targets are living,
breathing objects. Sometimes he may stealthily approach,
unobserved, and secure an aim while the object is at rest;
again, the bird flies, the beast runs, and then his scientific calculation
must be quick and accurate. But in both of these
the disturbing element of probable, almost certain, retaliation
is lacking. The excitement of rivalry or the enthusiasm,
added to the uncertainty, of the chase may somewhat agitate
the nerves of the shooter. His own safety is assured, however.
How often do we read of a meeting on the miscalled
“field of honor” of two men, both famous as pistol-gallery
shots; men with whom to hit the “bull’s-eye” nine times out
of ten shots is a common occurrence, yet who exchange leaden
compliments that are as barren of results as would be the
feeding of a hungry man on “angel food.” What is the cause
of this? It is the actual, assured knowledge that in this
instance the targets are equally animate, equally prepared
thoroughly for retaliatory action, both equally anxious, and as
capable of hitting the target the one as the other, and a sure
consequence is that the nerves of both shooters are “like
sweet bells, jangled, out of tune.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
The soldier whose lessons in the handling of fire-arms
have been learned on many a hard-fought field has acquired a
steadiness of nerve, a sort of reckless fearlessness, and, at
times, even a contempt for danger which its constant presence
has taught him. All honor to the soldiers who in steady
column, shoulder to shoulder, or in dashing charge to the shrill
cry of the bugle, have fearlessly breasted the scathing fire of the
enemy’s guns. But in this case the inspiriting association of
comrades, the encouraging sense of companionship, cheers
them on, and they at least momentarily fail to really appreciate
the thorough seriousness of their situation.</p>

<p>How different from all these pictures is that of the daring
scout, the intrepid cowboy, the faithful guide, of the unsettled
West. To either of these danger is so constant, so frequent
in its visitations, that it has become an expected presence.
An ear quick to detect a rustle of the leaves, a footfall on the
turf, the click of the hammer of a rifle; an eye to instantaneously
penetrate into the thickness of the brush; to detect,
locate, and photograph a shifting speck on the horizon; to
measure distance at a glance, and to fix the threatening target’s
vulnerable point in an instant are absolute necessities.
Added to these, as an absolute essential, must be nerves as
tense as steel. A tremor of the arm, nay, the slightest quiver
of a muscle, that sends the bullet a hair’s-breadth from the
point aimed at, may cost not only the death of the shooter,
but the lives of those depending on him for safety. No fancy
shooting this; for more than life&mdash;honor and reputation, the
preservation of sacred trusts and cherished lives committed
to his care, depend upon his coolness, his courage, and his
accuracy. In a moment all will be over for good or ill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
and upon his single personality all depends. The stake is
fearful.</p>

<p>These indubitable facts considered, is it surprising that
these danger-baptized heroes of the West stand to-day as the
most marvelous marksmen of the world?</p>

<p>The amateur sportsman, the society expert rifle-shot, the
ambitious youth, and even woman, to whom all real manly
exploits and true heroism are admirable, all take sincere
pleasure in witnessing the feats of marksmanship of the cowboy,
scout, or guide expert, and wonder at his marvelous
accuracy. It is because actual necessity was the foundation
upon which their expertness was built that these surpass all
others in the science. What appears wonderful to others is
in them but the perfection of art.</p>

<p>Looking at expert shooting as a pastime, a science, or a
means of protection or self-preservation, the awakening of the
manhood of the country and the up-growing youth to its possibilities
is surely to be commended and encouraged. No man
is more to be credited with the accomplishment of this than
Gen. W.&nbsp;F. Cody. His romantic and picturesque history and his
wonderful accomplishments have attracted to him the attention
of America and Europe, and no one man is more capable
of exemplifying the science of shooting than he. A graduate,
with high honors, of the school where expert shooting is
taught by the best practice and actual experience, he is master
of his art. The object-lessons he gives are of incalculable
benefit to the ambitious student of marksmanship, and sources
of delight to all. His trusty rifle is now a social friend,

<span class="subhead">A MOST FAMOUS RIDE.</span></h2>

<p>In the spring of 1868, at the outbreak of the violent Indian
war, General Sheridan, from his headquarters at Hays City,
dispatched Cody as guide and scout to Captain Parker at Fort
Larned. Several bands of Comanches and Kiowas were in
the vicinity, and Buffalo Bill, after guiding General Hazen
and an escort of twenty men to Fort Sarah, thirty miles distant,
started to return to Larned alone. At Pawnee Rock,
about half-way, he found himself suddenly surrounded by
about forty warriors. By professions of friendship and warm
greeting of “How, how!” Bill saw he could alone depend
on cunning and strategy to escape. Being taken before
Santanta, who Bill knew was expecting, a short time before,
a large herd of cattle which had been promised by General
Hazen, he boldly complained to the wily chief of his treatment,
and informed him that he had been ordered to find him
and deliver “a big heap lot who-haws.” The cupidity of old
Santanta enabled Bill to regain his arms. Although declining
an escort, he was followed, much to his alarm, by a dozen
well-mounted redskins. Keeping up “a heap of thinking,”
Cody at last reached a depression that hid him from view, and
succeeded, by putting the mule at his highest speed, in getting
fully a mile in advance before the trailers discovered his
object.</p>

<p>Upon seeing the fleeing scout, there were no further
grounds for suspecting his motives; so the Indians, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
mounted on excellent ponies, dashed after him as though they
were impelled by a promise of all the whisky and bacon in
the big father’s commissary for his scalp. Bill was trying to
save his hair, and the Indians were equally anxious to save it,
so that the ride, prompted by these diametrically opposed
motives, was as furious as Tam O’Shanter’s. After running
over about three miles of ground, Bill turned his head, only
to be horrified by the sight of his pursuers gaining rapidly on
him. He now sank the spurs a little deeper into his mule,
let out another inch of the reins, and succeeded in increasing
the speed of his animal, which appeared to be sailing under a
second wind.</p>

<p>It was thus the chase continued to Ash Grove, four miles
from Fort Larned, at which point Bill was less than half a
mile ahead of the Indians, who were trying to make line shots
with him and his mule as a target. Reaching Pawnee Fork,
he dashed into that stream, and as he gained the opposite
shore, and was rounding a thick clump of trees, he was
rejoiced to meet Denver Jim, a prominent scout, in company
with a private soldier, driving a wagon toward the post.</p>

<p>A moment spent in explanation determined the three men
upon an ambush. Accordingly the wagon was hastily driven
into the woods, and posting themselves at an advantageous
point they awaited the appearance of the red-skinned pursuers.
“Look out!” said Bill; “here they come, right over
my trail.” True enough, the twelve painted warriors rode
swiftly around the clump of brush, and the next instant there
was a discharge of shots from the ambush which sent two
Indians sprawling on the ground, where they kicked out their
miserable existence. The others saw the danger of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
position, and making a big circle rode rapidly back toward
their war-party.</p>

<p>When the three men reached Larned, Buffalo Bill and
Denver Jim each displayed an Indian scalp as trophies of a
successful ambush, and at the same time apprised Captain
Parker of the hostile character of Santanta and his tribe.</p>

<p>On the following day about eight hundred warriors appeared
before the fort, and threatened to storm it; but being met
with a determined front they circled around the post several
times, keeping the soldiers inside until their village could
move off. Considerable fear was entertained at the fort,
owing to the great number of hostile Indians who practically
invested it, and it was determined by Captain Parker as of the
utmost importance to send dispatches to General Sheridan,
informing him of the situation. Fort Hays was sixty-five
miles distant from Fort Larned, and, as the country was fairly
swarming with the worst kind of “bad” Indians, Captain
Parker tried in vain to find some one who would carry the
dispatches, until the request was made to Buffalo Bill. This
expedition was not within Bill’s line of duty, and presented
dangers that would have caused the boldest man to hesitate;
but finding all the couriers absolutely refusing to perform the
necessary service, he agreed to deliver the message, provided
that he could select the horse that he wanted to ride. Of
course this requirement was readily assented to, and at 10
o’clock at night, during a terrible storm, the brave scout set
out, knowing that he had to run a very gauntlet of hostiles,
who would make many sacrifices if by so doing they could
lift his coveted scalp.</p>

<p>The profound darkness of the night afforded him some
security from surprise, but his fears of riding into an Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
camp were realized when he reached Walnut Creek. A barking
dog was the first intimation of his position, but this was
speedily followed by several Indians pursuing him, being
directed by the sounds of his horse’s feet. By hard riding and
good dodging, however, he eluded these, and meeting with no
further mishap than being thrown over his horse’s head by
reason of the animal suddenly stepping into a gopher-hole, he
reached Fort Hays shortly after daylight, and delivered the
dispatches he carried before General Sheridan had arisen from
bed.</p>

<p>After delivering the message Bill went over to Hays City,
where he was well acquainted, and after taking some refreshments
lay down and slept for two hours. Thinking then that
General Sheridan might want to ask him some questions
regarding the condition of affairs at Larned, he returned
to the fort and reported to him. He was somewhat astonished
to find that General Sheridan was as anxious to send a
messenger to Fort Dodge, ninety-five miles distant, as Captain
Parker had been to communicate with his superior officer
at Fort Hays; and more surprised was he to find that of the
numerous couriers and scouts at the fort not one could be
induced to carry the general’s dispatch, though the sum of
$500 was offered for the service. Seeing the quandary
in which General Sheridan was placed, Bill addressed that
official, and said:</p>

<p>“Well, General, I’ll go over to the hotel and take a little
more rest, and if by 4 o’clock you have not secured some
one to carry your dispatches, I will undertake to do it.”</p>

<p>The general replied: “I don’t like to ask so much of you,
for I know you are tired; but the matter is of great importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
and some one must perform the trip. I’ll give you a
fresh horse, and the best at the fort, if you’ll undertake it.”</p>

<p>“All right, General; I’ll be ready at 4 o’clock,” replied
Bill, and then he went over to the hotel; but meeting with
many friends, and the “irrigating” being good, he obtained
only the rest that gay companionship affords. At the
appointed time Bill was ready, and receiving the dispatches at
the hands of General Sheridan he mounted his horse and rode
away to Fort Dodge. After his departure there was much
debate among the scouts who bade him good-by respecting
the probability of his getting through, for the Indians were
thick along the whole route, and only a few days before had
killed three couriers and several settlers. Bill continued his
ride all night, meeting with no interruption, and by daylight
next morning he had reached Saw-Log Crossing, on Pawnee
Fork, which was seventy-five miles from Fort Hays. A company
of colored cavalry, under Major Cox, was stationed here,
and it being on the direct route to Fort Dodge, Bill carried a
letter with him from General Sheridan requesting Major Cox
to furnish him with a fresh horse upon his arrival there; this
the major did; so after partaking of a good breakfast
Bill took his remount and continued on to Dodge, which
point he gained at 10 o’clock in the morning, making the
ninety-five miles in just eighteen hours from the time of
starting.</p>

<p>The commanding officer at Fort Dodge after receiving
the dispatches remarked:</p>

<p>“I am very glad to see you, Cody, and I’ll tell you that the
trip just made is one of the most fortunate I know of. It is
almost a miracle how you got through without having your
body filled as full of holes as a pepper-box. The Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
are swarming all around within fifty miles of here, and to
leave camp voluntarily is almost equal to committing suicide.
I have been wanting to send a message to Fort Larned for
several days, but the trip is so dangerous that I can’t find
any one who will risk it, and I wouldn’t blame the bravest man
for refusing.”</p>

<p>“Well, Major, I think I might get through to Larned; in
fact I want to go back there, and if you will furnish me with
a good horse I’ll try to carry your message.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would be policy for you to make the trip
now, especially since you have done so much hard riding
already. Besides, the best mount I could give you would be
a government mule.”</p>

<p>“All right, Major, I don’t want the best; second-best is
good enough for me; so trot out your mule. I’ll take a little
nap, and in the meantime have your hostler slick up the mule
so that he can slide through with me like a greased thunderbolt
should the reds jump on us.”</p>

<p>Bill then went off, and, after “liquidating” in true Western
style, lay down in the major’s quarters, where he slept soundly
until nearly 5 o’clock in the evening, when, having replenished
his canteen, he mounted the patient mule and set out for Fort
Larned, which was sixty-five miles east of Fort Dodge.</p>

<p>After proceeding as far as Coon Creek, which was nearly
half-way, Bill dismounted for the purpose of getting a drink
of water. While stooping down the mule got frightened at
something and jerked loose; nor did the stupid animal stop,
but followed the trail, keeping ahead of the weary and chagrined
scout for <i>thirty-five miles</i>. Half a mile from the fort
Bill got within rifle range of his exasperating steed and gave
him a furlough to the eternal grazing-grounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
After reaching Larned&mdash;carrying the bridle and saddle
himself&mdash;Buffalo Bill spent several hours in refreshing sleep,
and when he awakened he found General Hazen trying to
induce some of the couriers to take his dispatches to General
Sheridan at Fort Hays. Having been warmly and very justly
praised for the long and perilous rides he had just completed,
Bill again proffered his service to perform the trip. At first
General Hazen refused to dispatch him on the mission, saying,
“This is like riding a free horse to death; you have
already ridden enough to kill an ordinary man, and I don’t
think it would be treating you properly to permit you to make
this additional journey.”</p>

<p>But when evening came and no other volunteer could be
engaged, as a matter of last resort Bill was given a good
horse and the dispatches intrusted to him for transmission.
It was after nightfall when he started on this last trip, and by
daylight the next morning he was in Fort Hays, where he
delivered the dispatches. General Sheridan was profoundly
astonished to see Bill before him again in so short a time, and
after being informed of his wonderful riding during the three
days the general pronounced it a feat that was never equaled;
and even now General Sheridan maintains that no other man
could accomplish the same distance under similar circumstances.
To this day the rides here described stand on record
as the most remarkable ever made. They aggregated <i>three
hundred and fifty-five miles in fifty-eight riding hours</i>, or an
average of more than <i>six miles an hour</i>, including an enforced
<i>walk of thirty-five miles</i>. When it is considered that all this
distance was made in the night-time, and through a country
of hostile Indians, without a road to follow or a bridge to
cross the streams, the feat appears too incredible for belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
were it not for the most indisputable evidence, easily attainable,
which makes disbelief impossible.</p>

<p>General Sheridan was so favorably impressed with the
self-sacrificing spirit and marvelous endurance of Buffalo
Bill, and being already acquainted with his reputation as a
brave man, that he called the scout to his headquarters
directly after receiving Major Hazen’s dispatches, and said:</p>

<p>“Cody, I have ordered the Fifth Cavalry to proceed
against the Dog Soldier Indians, who are now terrorizing
the Republican River district; and as the campaign will be
a very important one, I want a first-class man to guide the
expedition. I have therefore decided to appoint you guide,
<i>and also chief of scouts of the command</i>.”</p>

the success of your enterprise. I was much interested in the
various lifelike representations of Western scenery, as well as
the fine exhibition of skilled marksmanship and magnificent

features of frontier life, but also the difficulties and dangers
that have been encountered by the adventurous and fearless
pioneers of civilization. The wild Indian life as it was a few
years ago will soon be a thing of the past, but you appear to
have selected a good class of Indians to represent that race of
people. I regard your exhibition as not only very interesting,
but practically instructive. Your services on the frontier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>

<p>I often recall your valuable services to the Government,

<span class="subhead">BUFFALO BILL’S BOYHOOD.</span></h2>

<p>Having in the preceding pages given the scenes, conditions,
surroundings, and types of characters that made up the
theater of action in which Buffalo Bill bore so prominent a
part, with the letters from gallant commanders stamping his
career with the brand of truth, it is fitting to start my hero
from the threshold of boyhood, and follow him through his
most adventurous and phenomenal life up to the present day,
where he stands unchallenged as the Chevalier Bayard of
American bordermen.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill made his debut upon the stage of life in a
little log cabin situated in the backwoods of Scott County,
Iowa. His father and mother were good honest people, poor
in this world’s goods, but rich in hope, faith in each other
and the result of their efforts, and confidence in the future.</p>

<p>While struggling for success as a farmer Isaac Cody became
seriously affected by the California gold fever that raged at
that time; a party was organized, an outfit provided, and a
start was made. A failure resulted, and all comprising the
party returned to their respective homes at La Clair.</p>

<p>Bill was sent to school, where he familiarized himself with
the alphabet; but further progress was arrested by a suddenly
developed love for boating on the Mississippi, which occupied
so much of his time that he found no convenient opportunity
for attendance at school, his parents, however, not having the
slightest idea of his self-imposed employment as a boatman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Shortly after his removal to La Clair Mr. Cody was chosen
justice of the peace, then was elected to the Legislature, positions
which he held with honor but without profit.</p>

<p>A natural pioneer, he hunted for new fields of adventure,
and following his inclination he disposed of a small ranch he
owned, packed his possessions in one carriage and three
wagons, and started for the plains of Kansas. Mr. Cody had
a brother living at Weston, near the Kansas line, a well-to-do
merchant of that place, with whom he stopped until he could
decide upon a more desirable location for his family. It was
on this trip that Buffalo Bill had his first sight of a negro, of
whom he stood in great awe. It was also while on this expedition
he ate his first wheat bread, something he had never
heard of before, corn-dodgers being the chief staff of life at
that time.</p>

<p>Mr. Cody remained but a short while at Weston, when he
went to the Kickapoo Agency in Leavenworth, Kan. He
established a trading-post at Salt Creek Valley, while he settled
his family upon a ranch near by. At that time Kickapoo
was occupied by numerous tribes of Indians, who were settled
upon the reservations, and through the territory ran the great
highway of California and Salt Lake City. In addition to the
thousands of gold-seekers who were passing through by way
of Fort Leavenworth, there were many Mormons going westward,
and this extensive travel made trade profitable. With
these caravans were those fractious elements of adventurous
pioneering, the typical Westerner, with white sombrero, buckskin
clothes, long hair, moccasined feet, and a belt full of
murderous bowies and long pistols. Instead of impressing
him, however, with trepidation, they inspired in him an ambition
to become likewise. Their skillful feats of horsemanship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
which he witnessed, bred in him a desire to become an expert
rider, and when, at seven years of age, his father gave him a
pony the measure of his happiness was filled to overflowing.
Thenceforth his occupation was horseback-riding, and he
made himself useful to his father in many ways.</p>

<p>During his early life at this post Buffalo Bill spent much
of his time with the Indians, who taught him how to shoot
with bow and arrow, and he joined in their other sports, soon
learning the Kickapoo language more readily than he had his
alphabet. Being friendly with the Indians Mr. Cody at times
gave them barbecues, at which they indulged in their fantastic
war-dances, the sight of which excited admiration in the
youthful William. It was at this time that Buffalo Bill first
met his friend Alexander Majors of the freighting firm of
Russell &amp; Majors, and he has since then been his lifelong
friend.</p>

<p>Writers of American history are familiar with the disorders
which followed upon the heels of the Enabling Act. The
western boundary of Missouri was ablaze with the camp-fires
of intending settlers. Thousands of families were sheltered
under the canvas of the ox-wagons, awaiting the announcement
of the opening of the Territory; and when the news was
heralded they poured over the boundary-line and deluged the
new domain. Those who came from Missouri were intent
upon extending slavery into the Territory, while those who
came from Illinois, Iowa, and Indiana were opposed to bringing
slaves into the new Territory. It was over this question
that the border warfare began; men were shot down in their
homes, by the fireside, in the furrows behind the plow; widows
and orphans multiplied; the arm of industry was paralyzed.
The incendiary torch lit up the prairie, burning homes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
destroying their storehouses and granaries. Anguish sat on
every threshold, pity had no abiding-place, and for several
years the besom of destruction rendered every heart on the
borderland sad and despondent. In this war of vengeance
the Cody family did not escape. One night a body of armed
men surrounded the Cody home. Knowing what they had
come for, Mr. Cody disguised himself and walked out of the
house and managed to escape. Discovering this, the band
carried off all the valuables in the house and about the
premises, drove off the horses, and Bill’s pony among them;
but the pony escaped and came back to his young master.
Learning that another attempt was to be made to capture Mr.
Cody, having learned of his hiding-place, Mrs. Cody started
Bill off on his pony to give warning to his father of his
danger. The boy had ridden only a few miles when he came
upon a party of men camped at the crossing of Stranger
Creek. Hearing one of them call out, “That is Cody’s son,
catch him,” the brave lad instantly started to dash through
them, knowing that it was a matter of life and death to his
father. He was instantly pursued, but eluded capture, joined
his father, and warned him of his danger. From that time on
Mr. Cody’s visits to his home were made secretly, and soon
after it was that he lost his life, dying from the effects of a
wound he received.</p>

<p>After the death of his father, though a mere boy, Buffalo
Bill applied for employment to Mr. Alexander Majors of the
firm of Majors &amp; Russell, overland freighters. Mr. Majors
said to him:</p>

<p>“Billy, my boy, I will give you $25 a month as messenger,
and this sum is what I pay a man for the same work.”</p>

<p>Bill gladly accepted the offer, and at ten years of age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
began work. For two months, mounted on a little gray mule,
Bill’s duties were to herd cattle. At the end of that time he
was paid his $50 in one-half dollar pieces, and, putting the
bright silver coins into a sack, he started for home, feeling
himself a millionaire. Every dollar of that money he gave
to his mother. Thus began his services for the firm of
Majors &amp; Russell, afterward Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell, in
whose employ he spent seven years in different capacities,
such as messenger, wagon-master, pony-express rider, and
stage-driver.</p>

<span class="subhead">BILL KILLS HIS FIRST INDIAN.</span></h2>

<p>Like all boys Bill had a sweetheart with whom he was
“dead in love,” in a juvenile way, of course. He had a rival
of whom he was terribly jealous. One day, attacked by his
rival, who was an older and larger boy, Buffalo Bill defended
himself with his pocket-knife, wounding the youth slightly.
The cry at once arose, “Bill Cody has killed Steve Gobel!”
and, terribly frightened at what he had done, Bill immediately
took refuge in flight, the teacher in hot pursuit. Fortunately
for Bill one of Russell &amp; Majors’ freight trains was passing
beyond the hills on its way to the West. Reaching it he
recognized the wagon-master with whom he had before served.
He was concealed in one of the wagons until night, when he
went to his home, bade his mother and sisters good-by, and
continued on with the train to the far West. The trip proved
one of delightful experience to the boy, and on his return he
was paid off with the rest of the employes, when he went to
herding cattle for the same firm.</p>

<p>After a few months spent at this work, he started with a
herd of beef-cattle for Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston’s army,
which was then marching across the plains to fight the Mormons.
Reaching South Platte River they were camped for
dinner, and had no idea of danger near, when, with shouts and
yells, a band of Indians dashed in upon them. A hot fight
followed, and three of the party were killed. Buffalo Bill, with
the rest of the band, was driven to seek safety under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
river-bank, keeping the Indians at a safe distance with their
guns. It was on this occasion that Buffalo Bill killed his
first Indian, being at that time but eleven years old. As the
cattle had been stampeded by the Indians, and the horses
also, the little party was forced to return to Fort Kearney.
After many hardships and passing through many dangers,
the fort was reached, though several of the party were
wounded and had to be carried by their comrades. A company
of cavalry and force of infantry, with one gun, were sent
out to endeavor to capture the cattle, Buffalo Bill and his
comrades accompanying the expedition. Upon reaching the
place where the fight occurred, the bodies of their comrades
were found literally cut to pieces, and but few of the
stampeded cattle were captured.</p>

<p>Upon his return to Fort Leavenworth the young Indian
fighter found that he was published far and wide as the
youngest Indian killer on record; in fact a juvenile celebrity.
What bearing this taste of laudation had on his future career
may easily be inferred.</p>

<p>The following summer Buffalo Bill engaged at $40 per
month, in gold, to go with the wagon-trains carrying supplies
to Gen. Albert S. Johnston’s army. The trail of the train was
through Kansas into Nebraska, near the Big Sandy, then running
sixty miles along the Little Blue, striking the Platte
River near old Fort Kearney; then up the South Platte, then
across to the North Platte, near the mouth of the Blue Water,
where General Harney fought his great battle in 1865 with
the Sioux and Cheyenne Indians. From this point the train
continued on to the Great Salt Lake Valley. At that time Russell,
Majors &amp; Waddell had upon the overland trails nearly
seven thousand wagons; 75,000 oxen, 2,000 mules, and 8,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
men were employed, while the capital invested amounted
to $2,000,000. The expedition was without adventure of
importance until the South Platte River was reached. The
country was alive with buffalo roaming in all directions, and
among them were found some of the herd of cattle stampeded
by the Indians long before. Discovering the herd of buffaloes
ahead, they at the same time sighted a party of returning
Californians, and, being between two fires, the buffalo herd
stampeded at once, and broke down the hills, some thousands of
them rushing through the wagon-train. Wagons were turned
over, poles were broken, buffaloes were mixed up among
the terrified oxen and shouting men, who were unable to manage
their teams. Many of the oxen broke their yokes and
stampeded, and the frantic buffaloes played havoc with the
train. This caused several days’ delay to repair damages and
gather up the scattered teams. When the train reached
within eighteen miles of the Green River, in the Rocky
Mountains, a party of twenty horsemen came up. They were
covered at once with guns, and the wagon-train men found
that they were in the hands of the Mormons, who were at
that time engaged in hostilities against the Army of the
United States. It was impossible to resist, and Simpson was
forced to submit, first, however, soundly abusing the apostles.</p>

<p>The Mormons took from the wagons all the provisions
they could carry, then set fire to the train and drove off the
oxen. The trainmen, however, were allowed to retain their
arms, one wagon, six yoke of oxen, and provisions enough to
last the party until Fort Bridger could be reached.</p>

<p>It was late in November when the party reached the fort,
and they decided to spend the winter there, in company with
about four hundred other employes of Russell, Majors &amp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Waddell, rather than attempt to return, which would have
exposed them to many dangers and the severity of the coming
winter. During this period of rest the commissary became
so depleted that the men were placed on one-quarter rations;
and at last, as a final resort, the poor, dreadfully emaciated
mules and oxen were killed for food for the famishing men.</p>

<p>Fort Bridger being located in a prairie, fuel had to be
carried nearly two miles, and after the mules and oxen were
butchered the men were compelled to carry the wood on their
backs or haul it on sleds.</p>

<p>But for the timely arrival of a train-load of provisions for
Johnston’s army many of the party would certainly have died
of hunger.</p>

<p>Arrangements having been made for a return to Fort
Leavenworth, all the employes at Fort Bridger concluded to
accompany the returning cavalcade. Simpson was chosen
brigade wagon-master of the new outfit, consisting of two
trains and 400 men.</p>

<p>When the train approached Ash Hollow Simpson decided
to leave the main road and follow the North Platte to its
junction with the South Platte. The two trains had become
separated, some fifteen or twenty miles between them, the
latter train in charge of Assistant Wagon-master George
Woods, under whom Billy was acting as “extra.”</p>

<p>Simpson, accompanied by Woods, desiring to reach the head
train, ordered Billy to “cinch” (saddle) up and follow him.
When the three reached Cedar Bluffs they suddenly discovered
a score of Indians emerging from the head of a ravine less
than half a mile distant and coming toward them with great
speed.</p>

<p>“Dismount and shoot your mules,” was the quick order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
issued by Simpson, who was at once alive to the situation.
As the stricken animals dropped in their tracks the two men
and little boy crouched down behind their bodies, which lay
together in a triangle, and using their dead bodies as breastworks
opened fire on the Indians with Mississippi yagers
and revolvers, killing three and wounding two ponies. The
redskins, surprised at the hot-bed they had struck, circled
around and sped away again, halting several hundred yards
distant, evidently for consultation. This gave the trio time
to load their weapons and prepare for a second charge, which
they felt sure would be made.</p>

<p>The Indians were armed with bows and arrows, which of
course required close range to be effective, and this gave the
little party an advantage which partly compensated for the
superior number of their enemy.</p>

<p>Little Billy showed so much pluck in the dangerous position
he occupied that Simpson could not help praising him,
and by way of further encouragement he said:</p>

<p>“My brave little man, do you see that Indian on the right,
riding out from the party to reconnoiter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m watching him,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Well, suppose you give him a shot, just by way of experiment.”</p>

<p>Billy at once extended himself, and resting his gun on the
body of the mule before him took steady aim and fired.</p>

<p>“Bully boy! A splendid shot!” shouted Simpson, as he
saw the Indian topple from his horse, struck in the side. The
distance was fully three hundred yards.</p>

<p>After a long parley the Indians scattered, and came
charging back again, whooping in a delirium of excitement.
When they had approached within less than one hundred yards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
the besieged party turned loose on them, shooting two more
out of the saddle; but the Indians rushed on, discharging a
shower of arrows, one of which pierced George Woods’ right
shoulder, producing a most painful wound. For a second
time the red warriors were repulsed, and they drew off again,
evidently for the purpose of resorting to other tactics. Getting
beyond the range of the yagers the Indians formed in a
large circle, tethered their ponies, and disposed themselves for
a siege, with the evident intention of starving out the brave trio.
About three hours afterward, however, the cracking of bull-whacker’s
whips was heard, and soon the advancing train was
seen coming over the hill. The Indians, appreciating what
this meant, and gaining their ponies, rode down on the little
party again, discharging another flight of arrows and receiving
a volley of bullets in return. No damage was inflicted on
either side in the last charge, and the three were saved.</p>

<p>After bandaging Woods’ wound the train started again,
and met with no further detention or accident, reaching Leavenworth
in July, 1858. Wild Bill had been a special companion
of Billy’s during the entire trip, and so warm had become
the attachment between them that the latter gave him a pressing
invitation to go with him to his home for a short visit; an
invitation that was accepted by Wild Bill.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE BOY MINER.</span></h2>

<p>Billy had been at home scarcely one month before he
engaged himself as assistant wagon-master to another train
which was made up at Fort Laramie to carry supplies to a
new post just established at Cheyenne Pass. He got through
this adventure without losing a team or a man.</p>

<p>Returning to Laramie he engaged with a Mr. Ward, the
post trader, to trap for beaver, mink, and otter on the Chug
Water, and poison wolves for their peltries. This enterprise
was not profitable, and two months after Billy returned to
Laramie, and in a few days, in company with two others, he
started back to Leavenworth.</p>

<p>When they reached the Little Blue the three were jumped
by a party of Indians. The darkness saved them, after a chase
of several hours. After “losing” the Indians the trio discovered
a cave in which they resolved to spend the night.
Lighting a match they were horrified to find the place tenanted
by the bones and desiccated flesh of murdered emigrants.
Without further investigation the three, badly frightened,
regardless of cold and snow, pushed rapidly onward. An all-night
journey brought them to Oak Grove, and there taking
in a fresh supply of necessaries they resumed their homeward
march, reaching Leavenworth in February, 1859.</p>

<p>Billy was now fourteen years old, and unusually large for
one of that age. His education having been neglected he,
yielding to his mother’s entreaties, resolved to attend a school
just opened in the neighborhood of Grasshopper Falls, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
for a period of ten weeks applied himself with diligence
and made most gratifying progress. This was the longest
term of schooling he ever attended, and it is doubtful if all
the schooling he ever received would aggregate six months;
though he is now comparatively well educated, his knowledge
has been acquired almost wholly by extensive travel and
association with polished people.</p>

<p>On the return of spring the old impulse seized on Billy
again to seek the far West, where adventure and danger incite
the restless spirit of brave men. The recent discovery of
gold at Pike’s Peak was a further motive for this move.</p>

<p>Billy, despite his years, was now a man in size, and in common
with thousands of others he seized a pick and set out
for the wonderful diggings. After digging around Aurora
for a few days the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">ignis fatuus</i> led him farther up the mountains
to Black Hawk, where he settled, and worked most
assiduously for a period of two months without finding as
much as a handful of pay dirt. In the meantime provisions
were so high that it took a Jacob’s ladder to reach the smell
of cold beans.</p>

<p>Billy became not only tired but disgusted with the result
of his mining labors and resolved to get out of the country.
He had no difficulty in finding others in camp of the same
turn of mind as himself, and such as he desired as companions
he induced to accompany him back. Of the numerous caravans
and individuals who adopted as their motto “Pike’s
Peak or bust,” Billy and his party fell back on the latter end
of the bold legend. They were so badly “busted” (?), in fact,
that the only conveyance left them was their legs. Setting
out on these the party proceeded to the Platte River, where
the idea possessed Billy that they might make the remainder
of their journey to Leavenworth on an improvised raft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
By various means, but chiefly by killing game along the
way, the party subsisted comfortably while they floated down
the stream on a rickety collection of logs. Matters were
satisfactory enough until they reached Jule’s ranch, or Julesburg,
where having met a swifter current the raft struck a
snag and went to pieces with a suddenness no less astonishing
than the bath which instantly followed. Fortunately,
though the North Platte is a broad stream it is generally
shallow, and the party had to swim but a short distance before
they found a footing, and then waded ashore.</p>

<p>Everything having been lost with the raft, including their
arms and such provisions as they had, the party stopped at
Julesburg to wait for something to turn up.</p>

<p>It so happened that the great Pony Express had just been
established between Omaha and Pike’s Peak, and other far
Western points, including San Francisco. This route ran by
Julesburg, where the company had an agent in the person of
George Chrisman, who was well acquainted with Billy, the two
having freighted together for Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell.</p>

<p>Finding Billy out of employment, and express riders being
scarce, Chrisman offered him a position as rider, which was
gladly accepted.</p>

<p>The requirements for this occupation were such that very
few were qualified for the performance of the duties. The
distance and time required to be made were fifteen miles per
hour. Only courageous men could be employed on account of
the dangers to be encountered, and such laborious riding could
be endured by very few. Nevertheless Billy was an expert
horseman, and having the constitution and endurance of a
bronco he braved the perils and duties of the position and was
assigned to a route of forty-five miles.</p>

<span class="subhead">STORY OF THE PONY EXPRESS.</span></h2>

<p>The glamour and pageantry of the crusaders in the
eleventh and twelfth centuries were revived in the fifteenth
and sixteenth by Columbus, Cortez, and Pizarro, and repeated
in the nineteenth by Taylor, Scott, Doniphan, and Fremont.
As a resultant were the wonderful gold discoveries of 1849, in
California, and a State born full-fledged and armed in a day,
as Minerva from the brain of Jove. Among the wonderful and
prolific accomplishments of Western thought and genius was
the conception and successful fruition of the Pony Express, a
scheme that could only have been conceived and launched
amid the mountain grandeur of the Western plains. It could
have birth in no other place, and can be duplicated nowhere
else. The world presents no theater for its reënactment. It
was formulated by Senator Gwinn of California, and fashioned
and matured to success by Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell of
the overland mail coach system of 1859, as established by
Congress.</p>

<div id="ip_113" class="figcenter" style="width: 310px;">
  <img src="images/i_114.jpg" width="310" height="267" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">RIDING PONY EXPRESS.</div></div>

<p>The telegraph extended from the Atlantic seaboard to St.
Joseph and from San Francisco to Sacramento. Two thousand
miles of desert intervened. The ocean communications,
via Central America, occupied twenty-two days, with propitious
sea voyages. Could this be reduced? The stages took
from twenty-one to twenty-five days, according to the weather.
Duke Gwinn, as he was afterward called, suggested to W.&nbsp;H.
Russell of the stage line that if the time could be shortened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
for communication on a central line, and kept open all the
year, a great increase of travel and emigration, and the location
of a railroad by the Government on a central route, would
be the result. The conference resulted in the habiliment of
the Pony Express, which eventuated in carrying a telegraph
mail upon ponies from St. Joseph to Sacramento, 1,982 miles,
regularly, from April, 1860, to September, 1861, in ten days,
schedule time, and the special express in December, 1860,
with a message of President Buchanan to Congress, on
secession, in seven days and seventeen hours, a feat never
before and never again to be accomplished. This was done
through a desert country occupied by prowling savages and
swept by violent storms, furious blizzards, and blinding snows.
Crossing immense mountain ranges and trackless wastes
of sand and sage-brush, grappling with mountain torrents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
and with nature’s wildest orgies, the hardy riders, whose
watchword was “excelsior,” always made (Deo volente) the
schedule time to the objective point. At St. Joseph and Sacramento,
until the completion of the telegraph across the
continent, the expectant crowd was never held in wait over an
hour before the messenger waved his red flag of safety, and
in the next instant slid from his panting steed and hastened
to the office of the company with his bag of dispatches, worth
its weight in gold.</p>

<p>During the Mexican War Congress added two new regiments
of mounted volunteers to the regular army under orders
to lay out a military road on the route taken by Fremont
in 1843 to Oregon. They were to locate posts, and changed
old Fort Kearney, then at the mouth of Tabor Creek, where
Nebraska City is now located, to the crossing of the Platte
River, where Kearney is now situated, and called it New
Fort Kearney, one at Laramie on the Platte River, fifty
miles north of Laramie City, now a station situated on the
Union Pacific Railroad, and one at old Fort Hall, a Hudson
Bay trading-post near the present site of Pocatella. This
was called the military route, and was the road traveled by
most of the emigrants to California in 1849. Passing by
Soda Springs and south of Snake River to the headwaters of
the Humboldt, or St. Marys River, through Nevada, it passed
through the South Pass and struck Bear River, now in Idaho
and Utah. The emigration of 1850 diverged southward from
Laramie and past Green River at its junction with Hams
Fork, through Echo Cañon and Salt Lake Valley westwardly
via Reese River, striking the Humboldt lower down, and
crossing the Sierra Nevada at the Truckee Pass and by
Donner Lake. This was a much more direct trail to California<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
and was used mostly thereafter by emigrants in 1850&ndash;51.
In 1854 two stage routes were established, one by Texas and
El Paso, on the Gila River, to Southern California, and one
via Salt Lake, the latter much the shorter, but mountainous.
McGraw &amp; Co. had the route on the military road from Independence
by Fort Leavenworth under a government subsidy,
and in 1859 Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell became the owners of
this mail line and operated it successfully for years.</p>

<div id="ip_116" class="figcenter" style="width: 323px;">
  <img src="images/i_116.jpg" width="323" height="152" alt="" /></div>

<p>In 1859 Senator Gwinn, then United States Senator from California,
and a devoted Union man, appealed to the stage company
to expedite travel and communications on the military
road, so as to have a central line available to the North and
South alike, and to demonstrate the possibilities of operating
it in midwinter. Strange to say, this grand Union man and
able statesman went into the Rebellion and lost his wonderful
prestige and influence in California, as well as a fortune, in
his fealty to his native State of Mississippi, and in 1866 was
made the Duke of Sonora by Maximilian, in the furtherance
of some visionary scheme of Western empire, but soon
died. His propositions were duly considered and responded
to by that famous firm, representatives of thrift, enterprise,
energy, and courage, who well deserve the commendation
of history and the gratitude of their countrymen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Russell was a Green Mountain boy, who before his majority
had gone West to grow up with the country; and after
teaching a three-months’ school on the frontier of Missouri
had hired to old John Aull of Lexington, Mo., at $30 per
month, to keep books, and was impressed in lessons of economy
by the anecdotes of Aull that a London company engaged
in the India trade had saved £80 per annum in ink by
omitting to dot the “i’s” and cross the “t’s,” when he was
emptying his pen by splashing the office wall with ink. Alexander
Majors is still living, venerable with years and honors,
a mountain son of Kentucky frontier ancestry, the colleague
and friend of Daniel Boone; and William Waddell, an ancestral
Virginian of the blue-grass region of Kentucky, bold
enough for any enterprise, and able to fill any missing niche
in Western wants.</p>

<p>The Pony Express was born from this conference, and the
first move was to compass the necessary auxiliaries to assure
success. Sixty young, agile, athletic riders were engaged and
420 strong and wiry ponies procured, and on the 9th of
April, 1860, the venture was simultaneously commenced from
St. Joseph and Sacramento City. The result was a success
in cutting down the time more than one half, and it rarely
missed making the schedule time in ten days, and in December,
1860, making it in seven days and seventeen hours. The
stations were from twelve to fifteen miles apart, and one pony
was ridden from one station to another, and one rider made
three stations, and a few dare-devil fellows made double duty
and rode eighty or eighty-five miles. One of them was
Charles Cliff, now a citizen of St. Joseph, who rode from St.
Joseph to Seneca and back on alternate days. He was
attacked by Indians at Scotts Bluff, and received three balls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
in his body and twenty-seven in his clothes. Cliff made Seneca
and back in eight hours each way.</p>

<p>Another of these daring riders of this flying express was
Pony Bob.</p>

<div id="ip_118" class="figcenter" style="width: 339px;">
  <img src="images/i_118.jpg" width="339" height="150" alt="" /></div>

<p>But the one of these pony riders who has won greatest
fame was William F. Cody (“Buffalo Bill”), who passed
through many a gauntlet of death while in his flight from
station to station bearing express matter that was of the
greatest value.</p>

<p>The express was closed on the completion of a telegraph
line by Ed Creighton of Omaha from that point to Sacramento
City. The mail-bags were two pouches of leather, impervious
to rain and weather, sealed, and strapped to the rider’s saddle
before and behind, carrying two ounce letters or dispatches
at $5 each.</p>

<p>The keepers of the stations had the ponies already saddled,
and the riders merely jumped from the back of one to another;
and where the riders were changed the pouches were
unbuckled and handed to the already mounted postman, who
started at a lope as soon as his hand clutched them. As these
express stations were the same as the stage stations, the
employes of the stage company were required to take care of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
the ponies and have them in readiness at the proper moment.
The bridles and saddles were light weight, as were the
riders, and the pouches were not to contain over twenty
pounds of weight. There were two pouches of two pockets
each, and secured by oil-silk, then sealed, and the pockets
locked and never opened between St. Joseph and Sacramento.</p>

<p>This channel of communication was largely used by the
Government and by traders and merchants, and was a paying
venture, first semi-weekly and then daily, and but for the
building of the telegraph would have become a wonderful
success.</p>

<p>Every two or three hundred miles there were located at
the stations division agents to provide for emergencies in
case of Indian raids or stampedes of ponies, and at the crossing
of the Platte at Fort Kearney there was then employed
the notorious Jack Slade, a Vermont Yankee, lost to the teachings
of his early and pious environments, turned into a
frontier fiend. He shot a Frenchman named Jules Bevi, whose
patronymic is preserved in the present station of Julesburg on
the Union Pacific Railroad. Slade nailed one of his ears to
the station door and wore the other several weeks as a watch-charm.
He drifted to Montana, and in 1865 was hanged by
the vigilantes on suspicion of heading the road agents who
killed Parker of Atchison and robbed a train of $65,000.
His tragic end, as related by Doctor McCurdy, formerly of St.
Joseph, contains an element of the pathetic. He lived on a
ranch near Virginia City, Mont., and every few days came
into town and filled up on “benzine,” and took the place by
shooting along the streets and riding into saloons and proclaiming
himself to be the veritable “bad man from Bitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Creek.” The belief that he was connected with matters worse
than bad whisky had overstrained the long-suffering citizens.
The suggestive and mysterious triangular pieces of paper
dropped upon the streets, surmounted with the skull and
arrows, called the vigilantes to a meeting at which the death
of Slade and two companions was determined. On the fated
morning following the meeting he came to town duly sober
and went to a drug-store for a prescription, and while awaiting
its preparation he was suddenly covered with twelve shotguns
and ordered to throw up his hands. He complied
smilingly, but proposed to reason with them as to the
absurdity of taking him for a bad man. The only concession
was permission to send a note to his wife at the ranch, and an
hour was allotted him to make peace with the Unknown;
ropes were placed around the necks of the three, and at
the end of the time they were given short shrift, and were
soon hanging between heaven and earth. While the bodies
were swaying the wife appeared on the scene, mounted, with a
pistol in each hand, determined to make a rescue; but seeing
that it was too late she quailed before the determined visages
of the vigilantes, and soon left the vicinity, carrying away, as
it was believed, a large amount of the proceeds of Slade’s
robberies.</p>

<p>Most of the famous actors in that memorable enterprise
known as the Pony Express have passed beyond the confines
of time and gone to join the great majority. In the summer
of 1861 the Pony Express passed, with the overland stage
line, into the ownership of Ben Holliday, one of those wonderful
characters developed from adventure and danger, and
nurtured amid the startling incidents of frontier life. Born
near the old Blue Lick battle-field, he was at seventeen Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Doniphan’s courier to demand from Joe Smith and Brigham
Young the surrender of Farwest. At twenty-eight he
entered Salt Lake Valley with fifty wagon-loads of merchandise
and was indorsed by Brigham as being worthy of the confidence
of the faithful. This secured him a fortune. At
thirty-eight, at the head of the overland mail route, and at
forty-five, the owner of sixteen steamers on the Pacific, carrying
trade and passengers to Panama, Oregon, China, and
Japan. The stage route was sold to Butterfield, and ran until
the completion of the Union Pacific Railroad.</p>

<p>On the streets of Denver daily can be seen the grand
figure of Alexander Majors, carrying his four-score years with
a vigor that would shame half of the youth of the city. Six
feet, lithe and straight as the red man he so often dominated,
he is noted as the last of the Mohicans, and only waits, without
fear and without reproach, for the final summons to that
better land where the expresses are all faithfully gathered
and the faithful rewarded by commendations for duty well
performed.</p>

<p>And more wonderful than the express itself is the history
of the six lustrums since it ceased to exist. Two thousand
miles of desert waste have been largely developed in a rich
and valuable agricultural and pastoral region. The iron horse
has supplanted the fiery bronco, and thought flashes with
lightning rapidity from ocean to ocean. Civilization has
crowned that terra incognita with seven States and built large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
and beautiful cities. Peace has spread her halo of beauty
over the savage haunts and churches have supplanted the horrible
orgies of Indian massacre. The mountains have yielded
their treasures to the steady hand of industry&mdash;richer by far
than the fabled Ophir&mdash;and the pactolian streams have
gladdened the hearts of toiling thousands. All honor to the
pioneers who blazed the way for this civilization.</p>

<p>With this page of frontier history&mdash;the days of the Pony
Express&mdash;will forever be associated the name of Billy Cody.</p>

<span class="subhead">A RIDE FOR LIFE.</span></h2>

<p>“There’s Injun signs about, Billy, so keep your eyes
open.”</p>

<p>So said the station boss of the Pony Express trail, addressing
Buffalo Bill, who had dashed up to the cabin, his horse
panting like a hound, and the rider ready for the fifteen-mile
flight to the next relay. “I’ll be on the watch, Boss, you
bet,” said Billy Cody, the pony rider, and with a yell to his
fresh pony he was off like an arrow from a bow.</p>

<p>Down the trail ran the fleet pony like the wind, leaving the
station quickly out of sight, and dashing at once into the solitude
and dangers of the vast wilderness.</p>

<p>Mountains were upon either side, towering cliffs here and
there overhung the trail, and the wind sighed through the
forest of pines like the mourning of departed spirits.</p>

<p>Gazing ahead, the piercing eyes of the young pony rider
saw every tree, bush, and rock, for he knew but too well that
a deadly foe, lurking in ambush, might send an arrow or a
bullet to his heart at any moment.</p>

<p>Gradually, far ahead down the valley, his quick glance fell
upon a dark object above the bowlder directly in his trail.</p>

<p>He saw the object move and disappear from sight down
behind the rock.</p>

<p>Without appearing to notice it or checking his speed in the
slightest he held steadily upon his way.</p>

<p>But he took in the situation at a glance, and saw that upon
each side of the bowlder the valley inclined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Upon one side was a fringe of heavy timber, upon the
other a precipice, at the base of which were massive rocks.</p>

<p>“There is an Indian behind that rock, for I saw his head,”
muttered the young rider as his horse flew on.</p>

<p>Did he intend to take his chances and dash along the trail
directly by his ambushed foe?</p>

<p>It would seem so, for he still stuck to the trail.</p>

<p>A moment more and he would be within range of a bullet,
when, suddenly dashing his spurs into the flanks of his pony,
Billy Cody wheeled to the right, and in
an oblique course headed for the cliff.</p>

<div id="ip_124" class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
  <img src="images/i_124.jpg" width="120" height="264" alt="" /></div>

<p>This proved to the foe in ambush that
his presence there was suspected, if not
known, and at once there came the crack
of a rifle, the puff of smoke rising above
the rock where he was concealed.</p>

<p>At the same time a yell went up from
a score of throats, and out of the timber
on the other side of the valley darted a
number of mounted Indians, and these
rode to head off the rider.</p>

<p>Did he turn back and seek safety in
a retreat to the station?</p>

<p>No; he was made of sterner stuff, and would run the
gauntlet.</p>

<p>Out from behind the bowlder, where they had been lying
in ambush, sprang two painted braves, in all the glory of their
war-paint.</p>

<p>Their horses were in the timber with their comrades, but
they were armed with rifles, and having failed to get a close
shot at the pony rider they sought to bring him down at long
range.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
The bullets pattered under the hoofs of the flying pony,
but he was unhurt, and his rider pressed him to his full
speed.</p>

<p>With set teeth, flashing eyes, and determined to do or die,
Will Cody rode on in the race for life, the Indians on foot
running swiftly toward him and the mounted braves sweeping
down the valley at full speed.</p>

<p>The shots of the two dismounted Indians failing to bring
down the flying pony, or their human game, the mounted redskins
saw that their only chance was to overtake their prey by
their speed.</p>

<p>One of the number, whose war-bonnet showed that he was
a chief, rode a horse that was much faster than the others,
and he drew quickly ahead.</p>

<p>Below, the valley narrowed to a pass not a hundred yards
in width, and if the pony rider could get to this well ahead
of his pursuers he would be able to hold his own along the
trail in the 10-mile run to the next relay station.</p>

<p>But though he saw that there was no more to fear from
the two dismounted redskins, and that he would come out
well in advance of the band on horseback, there was one
who was most dangerous.</p>

<p>That one was the chief, whose fleet horse was bringing
him on at a terrible pace, and threatening to reach there
almost at the same time with the pony rider.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer the two drew toward the path, the
horse of Will Cody slightly ahead, and the young rider knew
that a death struggle was at hand.</p>

<p>He did not check his horse, but kept his eyes alternately
upon the pass and the chief.</p>

<p>The other Indians he did not then take into consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
At length that happened which he had been looking for.</p>

<p>When the chief saw that he would come out of the race
some thirty yards behind his foe, he seized his bow and quick
as a flash had fitted an arrow for its deadly flight.</p>

<p>But in that instant Will Cody had also acted, and a revolver
had sprung from his belt and a report followed the touching
of the trigger.</p>

<p>A wild yell burst from the lips of the chief and he clutched
madly at the air, reeled, and fell from his saddle, rolling over
like a ball as he struck the ground.</p>

<p>The death cry of the chief was echoed by the braves coming
on down the valley, and a shower of arrows was sent after
the fugitive pony rider.</p>

<p>An arrow slightly wounded his horse, but the others did no
damage, and in another second Will Cody had dashed into
the pass well ahead of his foes.</p>

<p>It was a hot chase from then on until the pony rider came
within sight of the next station, when the Indians drew off,
and William Cody dashed in on time, and in another minute
was away on his next run.</p>

<span class="subhead">HELD UP BY ROAD AGENTS.</span></h2>

<p>While riding Pony Express another adventure happened
to Buffalo Bill which illustrates his nerve under most trying
circumstances and great cleverness in getting out of scrapes.</p>

<p>It was when Buffalo Bill was in the Pony Express service
between Red Buttes and Three Crossings, which included the
perilous crossing of the Platte River, half a mile in width.</p>

<p>He rode into the station at the end of his run to find that
the man who was to go on from there had been killed by road
agents the night before.</p>

<p>There was nothing else for him to do but take the ride
himself, so Bill started promptly to do so. He darted away
upon his double duty and yet as he rode away he considered
that as his fellow-rider had been killed by road agents, he
stood a very fair chance of sharing the same fate.</p>

<p>It had become known in some mysterious manner, past
finding out, that there was to be a large sum of money sent
through by Pony Express and this was what the road agents
were after.</p>

<p>Missing it after killing the other rider, Will Cody very
naturally supposed that they would make another effort to
secure the treasure.</p>

<p>So when he reached the next relay station he walked
about a while longer than was his wont.</p>

<p>This was to perfect a little plan he had decided upon,
which was to take a second pair of saddle-pouches and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
something in them and leave them in sight, while those that
held the valuable express packages he folded up in his saddle-blanket
in such a way that they would not be seen unless
a search was made for them.</p>

<p>The truth was Buffalo Bill knew he carried the valuable
package and it was his duty to protect it with his life.</p>

<p>So with this clever scheme to outwit the road agents, if
held up, he started once more upon his flying ride.</p>

<p>He carried his revolver ready for instant use and flew
along the trail with every nerve strung to meet any danger he
might have to confront.</p>

<p>He had an idea where he would be halted, if halted at
all, and it was a lonesome spot in a valley, the very place for
a deed of crime to be committed.</p>

<p>As he drew near the spot Buffalo Bill was on the alert, and
yet when two men suddenly stepped out from among the shrubs
and confronted him it gave him a start in spite of his nerve.</p>

<p>They had him covered with their rifles, and they brought
him to a halt with the words, “Hold! Hands up, Pony
Express Bill, for we knows yer, and what yer carries.”</p>

<p>“I carry the express; and it’s hanging for two if you interfere
with me,” was the plucky response.</p>

<p>“Ah, we don’t want you, Billy, unless you force us to call
in your checks; but it’s what you carry, we want.”</p>

<p>“It won’t do you any good to get the pouch for there isn’t
anything valuable in it.”</p>

<p>“We are to be the judges of that, so throw us the valuables
or catch a bullet. Which will it be, Billy?”</p>

<p>The two men stood directly in front of the pony rider,
each one covering him with a rifle, and to resist was certain
death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
So Buffalo Bill began to unfasten the pouches slowly, while
he said, “Mark my words, men, you’ll hang for this.”</p>

<p>“We’ll take chances on that, Bill.”</p>

<p>The pouches being unfastened now, Buffalo Bill raised
them in one hand, while he said in an angry tone:</p>

<p>“If you will have them, take them.”</p>

<div id="ip_129" class="figcenter" style="width: 331px;">
  <img src="images/i_129.jpg" width="331" height="196" alt="" /></div>

<p>With this he hurled the pouches at the head of one of the
men, who quickly dodged and turned to pick them up, just as
Buffalo Bill fired upon the other man with his revolver in
his left hand.</p>

<p>The bullet shattered the man’s arm while, driving the
spurs into the flanks of his mare, Buffalo Bill rode directly
over the man who was stooping to pick up the pouches, his
back to the pony rider.</p>

<p>The horse struck him a hard blow that knocked him
down, while he half fell on top of him, but was recovered by
a touch of the spurs and bounded on, while the daring pony
rider gave a wild triumphant yell as he sped on like the
wind.</p>

<p>The fallen man, though hurt, scrambled to his feet as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
quickly as he could, picked up his rifle, and fired after the
retreating youth, but without effect; and Will Cody rode on,
arriving at the station on time, and reporting what had
happened.</p>

<p>He had however no time to rest, for he was compelled to
start back with his express pouches. He thus made the
remarkable ride of 324 miles without sleep, and stopping only
to eat his meals, and resting but a few minutes then. For
saving the express pouches he was highly complimented by
all, and years afterward had the satisfaction of seeing his
prophecy regarding the two road agents verified, for they were
both captured and hanged by vigilantes for their many
crimes.</p>

<span class="subhead">A YEAR OF ADVENTURES.</span></h2>

<p>Receiving an invitation from an old friend named Dave
Harrington to accompany him on a trapping expedition up
the Republican River, Buffalo Bill gladly accepted it, and
prepared for the perilous trip.</p>

<p>The two started out from Salt Creek Valley with an outfit
consisting of a wagon filled with traps and provisions, drawn
by a yoke of oxen.</p>

<p>It was near the middle of November when the two started
on the expedition, Mrs. Cody standing in the door when the
team moved off, wiping the tears from her eyes and giving
bounteous blessings to her beloved boy, watching with painful
emotions until the white cover of the wagon which sheltered
her dearest treasure became hidden by the prairie
undulations in the distance.</p>

<p>The two made excellent progress, and met with no detention,
arriving at the mouth of Prairie Dog Creek early in
December. Here they found an abundance of beaver, and
trapped with such success that they secured 300 beaver
and 100 otter skins before the severe weather interfered
with their occupation.</p>

<p>Having obtained a full load of pelts it was decided to
remain in the dug-out which they had constructed until the
beginning of spring, when the return trip could be made
without dangerous exposure.</p>

<p>During the period of waiting the two occupied much of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
time shooting elk, large numbers of which were roaming constantly
within convenient proximity. On one occasion while
out hunting and in pursuit of a large herd of elk, while passing
around a large rock projecting over a small ravine, Billy made
a false step and was precipitated onto the rocks below, the fall
breaking his leg between the knee and ankle. This accident,
always serious, was doubly so under the circumstances, when
no surgical aid could be had, nor any but a miserably insufficient
attention could be given to mitigate the injury. To add
still further to the misfortunes of the suffering boy, only a
few days before this accident one of the oxen had broken a
leg and Harrington had been compelled to shoot the animal.
Here the two trappers were, in the midst of winter storms,
without a team, and Billy rolling in an agony which his
partner was unable to relieve.</p>

<p>After discussing the situation for some time, Harrington
said:</p>

<p>“Well, Billy, this is a bad box, and the only way to get out
is for me to reach the nearest settlement and get a team to haul
you home.”</p>

<p>The poor boy, though he well knew that the nearest place
from which succor could be obtained was fully 125 miles distant,
and appreciated all the terrors of a long and painful
waiting alone among the hungry wolves and bands of equally
ferocious Indians, told Harrington to do as he thought best
about making the trip.</p>

<p>It is no less pathetic than astonishing the devotion which
is so often found among the Western pioneers, whose uncouth
language and grizzly garb, if taken as an index to their true
character, would lead to the inference that they are destitute of
that human kindness which redeems mankind and compensates
our vices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Brave Dave Harrington, just like Cody himself, big-hearted,
noble, generous, self-sacrificing, immediately prepared
for the tedious winter journey. Collecting about and
within convenient reach of Billy plenty of dried beef, water,
and other provisions needful for the sufferer’s subsistence,
Dave set out on the long trip, bidding his companion to be
cheerful and expect his return in twenty-one days.</p>

<div id="ip_135" class="figright" style="width: 263px;">
  <img src="images/i_135.jpg" width="263" height="483" alt="" /></div>

<p>Finding himself utterly alone, poor Billy&mdash;I say “poor”
because the facts can not fail to arouse the deepest pity and
make us sympathize with him even now in remembrance,
because sensibly affected by the realization of his terrible situation,
Billy lay on his rude bed, nursing the inflamed and
painful fracture, nothing to relieve his lonesomeness save
the howl of prowling wolves peering through the mud and
sticks and under the door. Ten days passed, when one evening
Billy was aroused by a singular noise outside the door. He
heard voices, and his experienced ear told him they were
Indians. Suddenly a dozen Sioux, led by Chief Rain-In-The-Face,
broke into the dug-out. Billy rose up from his
pallet and faced them as well as he could, expecting instant
death; but fortune favored him, as the chief recognized Billy,
having met him often at Laramie. The chief at once told
Billy that his life was safe; but the Indians remained all night,
feasting on the provisions found there, and when they left in
the morning carried away his weapons.</p>

<p>To add to his suffering a terrible snow-storm began, and
Billy knew that it would retard the coming of Harrington.
Starvation now threatened, and his leg became more painful
each day. At last the twenty-first day dawned; the fuel
had burned out; the suffering boy was forced to gnaw chunks
of frozen venison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
On the twenty-ninth day Dave Harrington arrived at the
hut with two oxen which he had driven through the snow.
The meeting between
the two can
not be described,
and Billy heard how
Harrington had
braved every danger
and hardship to
come back to his
rescue. A bed was
made of furs and
blankets in the
wagon and making
Billy as comfortable
as possible Harrington
set out for Junction
City. The sun
now came out and
melted the snow
and they experienced
no further
difficulty.</p>

<p>Arriving at Junction
City they sold
their furs at a good
price, and also the
team, and went to
Leavenworth with a government mule train. Harrington
would not desert Billy, and accompanied him home, where
every kindness was shown to the brave man who had saved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Billy’s life. Soon after their arrival at the Cody home Harrington
was taken ill, and after an illness of one week died.
Even to this day to speak of Dave Harrington to Buffalo
Bill, he will have something kind to say in memory of his
dearest friend.</p>

<p>It was months before Buffalo Bill recovered the use of his
leg so that he could go again to work; then he applied for
work on the Pony Express, and was engaged on a long and
dangerous run.</p>

<p>The condition of the country along the North Platte had
become so dangerous that it was almost impossible for the
Overland Stage Company to find drivers, although the
highest wages were offered. Billy at once decided to turn
stage-driver, and his services were gladly accepted.</p>

<p>While driving a stage between Split Rock and Three
Crossings he was set upon by a band of several hundred
Sioux. Lieutenant Flowers, assistant division agent, sat on
the box beside Billy, and there were half a dozen well-armed
passengers inside. Billy gave the horses the reins, Lieutenant
Flowers applied the whip, and the passengers defended
the stage in a running fight. Arrows fell around and struck
the stage like hail, wounding the horses and dealing destruction
generally, for two of the passengers were killed and
Lieutenant Flowers badly wounded. Billy seized the whip
from the wounded officer, applied it savagely, shouted
defiance, and drove on to Three Crossings, thus saving
the stage.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE ATTACK ON THE OVERLAND COACH.</div></div>

<p>This last trip proved so disastrous that it was decided to
use a band of mounted men to patrol the trail. This force
was placed under the command of Wild Bill, and Billy Cody
accompanied the expedition they made into the Indian country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
It proved to be a complete success and the hostiles
were severely punished, many being killed and hundreds of
horses captured.</p>

<p>While connected with the stage line Billy started out alone
on a bear-hunt. He had camped for the night and was picking
a sage-hen which he had shot when he heard the whinny
of a horse up the mountain. He at once proceeded to investigate
and came upon a dug-out with several horses staked
out near. Hearing voices within and concluding they were
trappers or hunters, he at once rapped on the door. The
door was opened and by the firelight he saw eight men, who
he at once knew were outlaws. Two of these men Billy recognized
as having been discharged by the Overland Stage
Company. Billy told them how he came to find their cabin,
and he was asked where his horse was.</p>

<p>“I left him tied at my camp down the mountain. I’ll leave
my gun here and go and bring him up,” replied Billy anxious
to get out of the hornet’s-nest in which he found himself.</p>

<p>Two of the villains at once offered their services to
accompany him, to his great regret, but he could do nothing
else than go with them, fully realizing the danger of his situation.
He knew if he returned to the cabin he would be killed,
and so he decided to act to save himself. Quick as lightning
he struck one of the outlaws a stunning blow over the head
with his pistol and as the other turned shot him dead; then
running to his horse he leaped into the saddle and fled down
the mountains. The trail was so rugged however that his
progress was slow and the shot having been heard in the
cabin the outlaws were soon in full pursuit, but fortunately
Billy managed to make his escape, eluding his pursuers in the
darkness, but having to desert his horse to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
It was twelve hours before he reached Horseshoe,
exhausted and half-famished. Reporting his adventure to
Alf Slade, a party of ten started at once under Billy’s guidance
to the outlaws’ cabin. They reached there after a ride
of six hours and found a new-made grave, but the place was
abandoned and there was nothing left to indicate their intention
to return. Billy was complimented in the most deserving
way for his bravery, and was put on the road again as
express rider, Wild Bill being his alternate; and the two made
better time than any other riders on the road.</p>

<span class="subhead">A SOLDIER OF THE CIVIL WAR.</span></h2>

<p>Cody learning of the serious illness of his loved mother
instantly saddled his horse and made all possible speed homeward.
He arrived at home to find his mother dying, and he
remained by her side, a devoted nurse, until she died.</p>

<p>Under the prairie sod, beneath the branches of a tree
planted by the hands of the loving son, sleeps the pioneer’s
wife and a true hero’s mother. Weeks after this most melancholy
incident in Billy’s life he went to Leavenworth and
joined the Seventh Kansas Jayhawkers, who were ordered to
service in Tennessee and Mississippi. After several battles
in Mississippi and Tennessee and hard service there the regiment
was ordered to Missouri. The courage, cunning, and
woodcraft displayed by Billy had not escaped the eye of his
commander, and he was made a scout with the rank of sergeant.
Serving in the capacity of scout, soldier, and spy he
rendered most valuable service to the North and was considered
the pride of General Smith’s corps.</p>

<p>As a soldier-scout Buffalo Bill won a great name and
passed through numberless adventures. While with the army
in Missouri Buffalo Bill again met his old “pard” of the plains,
Wild Bill, who had also won fame as a scout and spy.</p>

<p>Until 1865, Buffalo Bill remained in the army, and was
then detailed for special service at headquarters in St. Louis.
It was while there that he met Miss Louisa Frederici, a young
lady with whom he at once fell in love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

  <div class="caption">BRINGING BUFFALO-MEAT INTO CAMP.</div></div>

<p>Buffalo Bill’s phenomenal luck did not desert him as a
lover, for the lady is to-day his wife. Having fixed the date
for his marriage Buffalo Bill returned to the far frontier and
accepted the position of stage-driver over the same route
where he had killed his first Indian. He worked as a stage-driver
until he saved up a sufficient sum of money to return to
St. Louis and claim his bride.</p>

<p>He was married in 1866, the 6th of March, and the happy
couple took passage on a Missouri River steamer for Kansas,
where their home was to be. Arriving in Kansas Cody went
to Salt Creek Valley, where he established a hotel known as
the Golden Rule House, which he conducted with profit until
the old desire for life of stirring adventures induced him to
sell out and seek employment as a scout.</p>

<p>Going to Junction City he met Wild Bill, who was then
scouting for the Government, and by his advice he proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
to the military post at Ellsworth and at once went on duty.
While scouting and guiding parties he first met General
Custer who with ten men was at Ellsworth, looking for a
guide to conduct him to Fort Larned. Cody was selected for
the duty and to the day of his death Custer was a sincere
friend of Buffalo Bill’s.</p>

<p>Upon his return Cody was ordered to report to the Tenth
Cavalry as scout to guide an expedition against a large band
of Indians who had attacked the force working on the Kansas
Pacific Railroad.</p>

<p>The Indians were followed rapidly and overtaken, and
turning upon the regiment of colored troops they for awhile
stampeded them, capturing the howitzer. Major Ames, however,
rallied his men, and though badly wounded recaptured
the gun; but Cody discovering that another large force of
Indians was near at hand a retreat was begun, in which the
colored troops made remarkably good time. Night approaching,
the remnant of the command succeeded in reaching Hays,
and Cody declared that he would “never go Indian hunting
again with colored warriors,” but has since paid generous
tribute to their more experienced records.</p>

<p>While at Ellsworth Buffalo Bill met William Rose, a man
of many schemes and a railroad contractor. He disclosed to
Buffalo Bill a scheme to build a city and become a millionaire
out of its rise in value. Cody entered into the undertaking
with zest, selected a site on Big Creek one mile from Fort
Hays, and the town was duly laid out and the first house
built. The town was then christened Rome, and a lot was
donated to every one who would erect a building thereon.
In one month’s time there were 200 residences, 41 stores,
and 20 saloons in Rome, and lots were selling at $50 each.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Rome had begun to howl. But just as the dream of wealth
was about to be realized a stranger arrived in town. He
was the agent for the Kansas Pacific road, and not being
able to make terms with the two owners of the town, Cody
and Rose, he went west of Rome and laid out a town which
he named Hays City. As he placed there a machine-shop,
round-house, and depot, Rome was left out in the cold, and
Cody saw his anticipated fortune fade from his grasp.</p>

<span class="subhead">A CHAMPION BUFFALO-HUNTER.</span></h2>

<p>Having given up the real estate business Buffalo Bill
received a proposition from the Goddard Brothers, who had
contracted to furnish subsistence for thousands of construction
employes of the Kansas Pacific Railroad. The amount
required was very large to procure which involved hard
riding; but the labor was small compared with the danger to be
incurred from the Indians, who were killing every white man
they could find in that section. Nevertheless, an offer of
$500 per month for the service made Billy unmindful
of the exertion or peril, and he went to work under contract
to supply all the meat required. During this engagement
he had no end of wonderful escapes from bands of
Indians, not a few of whom he sacrificed to secure his own
safety. By actual count he also killed under his contract with
the Goddard Brothers, <i>four thousand two hundred and eighty
buffaloes</i>. To appreciate the extent of this slaughter, by
approximate measurement these buffaloes, if laid on the
ground end to end, would make a line more than five miles
long; and if placed on top of each other they would make a
pile two miles high.</p>

<div id="ip_145" class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;">
  <img src="images/i_144.jpg" width="280" height="380" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">SCOUTING FOR BUFFALOES.</div></div>

<p>By special arrangements all the heads of the largest buffaloes
killed by Bill were preserved and delivered to the Kansas
Pacific Railroad Company, by which they were turned into
excellent advertisements for the road. Many of these heads
may still be seen in prominent places, marking the center of
an oval board containing the advertisement of the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
So well had Cody performed his part of the contract that
the men connected with the Kansas Pacific road gave him
the appellation by which he is still known throughout the
world, “Buffalo Bill.”</p>

<p>A record of all his battles with the Indians during this
period of professional hunting would be so long that few
could read it without tiring, for there is a sameness connected
with attacks and escapes which it is difficult to recite in language
always sparkling with interest. But Buffalo Bill, being
a brave man under all circumstances when bravery is essential
and cautious when that element subserved the purpose
better, was almost daily in a position of danger, and many
times escaped almost like the Hebrew children from the
furnace.</p>

<p>So justly celebrated had Buffalo Bill now become that Kit
Carson, on his return from Washington City in the fall of
1867, stopped at Hays City to make his acquaintance. Carson
was so well pleased with Bill’s appearance and excellent social
qualifications that he remained for several days the guest of
the celebrated buffalo killer and scout. Upon parting, the
renowned Kit expressed the warmest admiration for his host,
and conveyed his consideration by inviting Bill to visit him at
Fort Lyon, Colo., where he intended making his home.
But the death of Carson the following May prevented the
visit.</p>

<p>Like every other man who achieves distinction by superior
excellence in some particular calling, Buffalo Bill (who
had now shed the familiar title of Billy) had his would-be
rivals as buffalo-killers. Among this number was a well-known
scout named Billy Comstock, who sought to dispute
the claim of champion. Comstock was quite famous among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
the Western army being one of the oldest scouts and most
skillful hunters. He was murdered by Indians seven years
after the event about to be recorded, while scouting for
Custer.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was somewhat startled one day upon receipt
of a letter from a well known army officer, offering to wager
the sum of $500 that Comstock could kill a greater number of
buffaloes in a certain given time, under stipulated conditions,
than any other man living. This was, of course, a challenge to
Buffalo Bill, who upon mentioning the facts, found hundreds
of friends anxious to accept the wager, or who would put up
any amount that Bill’s claim to the championship could not be
successfully disputed by any person living.</p>

<p>The bet was promptly accepted, and the following
conditions agreed to: A large herd of buffaloes being found,
the two men were to enter the drove at 8 o’clock <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, and
employ their own tactics for killing until 4 o’clock <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, at
the end of which time the one having killed the largest number
was to be declared winner of the wager and also the
“champion buffalo-killer of America.” To determine the
result of the hunt, a referee was to accompany each of
the hunters on horseback and keep the score.</p>

<p>The place selected for the trial was twenty miles east of
Sheridan, Kan., where the buffaloes were plentiful, and the
country being a level prairie rendered the hunt easy and
afforded an excellent view for those who wished to witness
the exciting contest.</p>

<p>Comstock was well mounted on a strong, spirited horse, and
carried a 42-caliber Henry rifle. Buffalo Bill appeared on his
famous horse Old Brigham; and in this he certainly had
great advantage, for this sagacious animal knew all about his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
rider’s style of hunting buffaloes, and therefore needed no
reining.</p>

<p>The party rode out on the prairie at an early hour in the
morning, and soon discovered a herd of about one hundred
buffaloes grazing on a beautiful stretch of ground just suited
for the work in hand. The two hunters rode rapidly forward,
accompanied by their referees, while the spectators followed
100 yards in the rear. At a given signal the two contestants
dashed into the center of the herd, dividing it so that Bill
took the right half while Comstock took those on the left.</p>

<p>Now the sport began in magnificent style, amid the cheers
of excited spectators, who rode as near the contestants as
safety and non interference permitted. Buffalo Bill, after
killing the first half dozen stragglers in the herd, began an
exhibition of his wonderful skill and strategy; by riding at
the head of the herd and pressing the leaders hard toward the
left, he soon got the drove to circling, killing those that were
disposed to break off on a direct line. In a short time witnesses
of this novel contest saw Buffalo Bill driving his portion
of the herd in a beautiful circle, and in less than half an
hour he had all those in his bunch numbering thirty-eight,
lying around within a very small compass.</p>

<p>Comstock, in the meantime, had done some fine work, but
by attacking the rear of his herd he had to ride directly
away from the crowd of anxious spectators. He succeeded
in killing twenty-three, which, however, lay irregularly over a
space three miles in extent, and therefore while he killed
fewer than his rival, he at the same time manifested less skill,
which by contrast showed most advantageously for Buffalo
Bill.</p>

<p>All the party having returned to the apex of a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
knoll, a large number of champagne bottles were produced,
and amid volleys of flying corks toasts were drunk to the
buffalo heroes, Buffalo Bill being especially lauded, and now
a decided favorite.</p>

<p>But these ceremonies were suddenly interrupted by the
appearance of another small herd of buffalo cows and calves,
into which the two contestants charged precipitately. In this
“round” Bill scored eighteen, while Comstock succeeded in
killing only fourteen.</p>

<p>The superiority of Buffalo Bill was now so plainly shown
that his backers, as well as himself, saw that he could afford
to give an exhibition of his wonderful horsemanship, while
continuing the contest, without fear of losing the stakes.
Accordingly, after again regaling themselves with champagne
and other appetizing accessories, the cavalcade of interested
spectators rode northward for a distance of three miles,
where they discovered a large herd of buffaloes quietly
browsing. The party then halted, and Buffalo Bill, removing
both saddle and bridle from Old Brigham, rode off on his
well-trained horse, directing him solely by motions of his hand.
Reaching the herd by circling and coming down upon it from
the windward quarter, the two rival hunters rushed upon the
surprised buffaloes and renewed the slaughter. After killing
thirteen of the animals, Buffalo Bill drove one of the largest
buffaloes in the herd toward the party, seeing which many
among the interested spectators became very much frightened,
showing as much trepidation, perhaps, as they would
have manifested had the buffalo been an enraged lion. But
when the ponderous, shaggy-headed beast came within a few
yards of the party Bill shot it dead, thus giving a grand <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup
d’état</i> to the day’s sport, which closed with this magnificent
exhibition of skill and daring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
The day having now been far spent, and time called, it was
found that the score stood thus: Buffalo Bill, sixty-nine; Comstock,
forty-six. The former was therefore declared winner,
and entitled to the championship as the most skillful buffalo-slayer
in America, and crowned forever with the title of
“Buffalo Bill.”</p>

<p>In referring to the fact that he has the record of having
killed far more game than other great hunters, Buffalo Bill,
who always speaks most modestly of all his exploits, gives
as a reason for his scoring greater numbers of buffalo, bear,
deer, elk, antelope, etc., that the huntsmen of years ago were
armed with muzzle-loading weapons, while it fell to his lot to
get the advantage of late inventions and be armed with the
very best of repeating rifles.</p>

<p>The fact that Buffalo Bill makes this statement in favor
of others shows how willing he is to give credit where credit
is due.</p>

<span class="subhead">SCOUT, GUIDE, AND INDIAN FIGHTER.</span></h2>

<p>After the great buffalo-killing match the name of Buffalo
Bill became familiar all over the country, and his exploits
were topics people never grew tired of discussing. All his
great battles with the Indians, valuable services as a scout,
and hairbreadth escapes were told and retold, not only at
the fireside, but around the camp-fires.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1868 a violent Indian war broke out in
Kansas, and General Sheridan, in order to be on the field, made
his headquarters at Hays City. Sending for Buffalo Bill General
Sheridan appointed him chief of scouts. From that
time on Buffalo Bill acted as scout and guide in all the
principal military operations upon that part of the frontier.</p>

<p>He was also appointed chief of scouts for the Fifth Cavalry
to proceed against the Dog Soldier Indians. The campaigns
of the Fifth Cavalry are matters of history, as are also the
services of Buffalo Bill, the letters of the commanding officers
speaking for themselves.</p>

<p>During his services as scout he served directly under
General Forsyth, Colonel Royall, Gen. E.&nbsp;A. Carr, General
Hazen, General Penrose, and others.</p>

<p>These officers, who had won fame upon the battle-fields of
the Civil War, many of them wearing the stars of a general,
found themselves ordered to the far frontier&mdash;when the South
had given up the struggle&mdash;to oppose the Indians, who were
making desperate efforts to kill off their pale-face foes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<div id="ip_152" class="figcenter" style="width: 371px;">

  <div class="caption">BUFFALO BILL AS A SCOUT.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
The truth was that the Indians regarded the Civil War
with feelings of delight, and as a blessing to them, as they
supposed that one side would utterly wipe out the other side,
and their victors being weakened by the struggle the redskins
could consolidate their forces, and attacking the remaining
whites drive them off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>They certainly made a bold effort to do so, and in the war
that followed the general officers were glad indeed to have
the services of Buffalo Bill as scout, guide, and Indian fighter.</p>

<p>In all the operations of the army upon the frontier Buffalo
Bill’s identity with them was such that to recount his valuable
services would be only to go over the pages of history.
The stories of his adventures, scouting expeditions, hunting
down desperadoes as a Government officer, and guiding of the
armies through trackless wildernesses have been told and
retold until every school-boy is familiar with them, and the
name of no one man is better known than that of Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>Early in September of 1871 a grand hunt was projected
by General Sheridan for the purpose of giving a number of
prominent gentlemen a buffalo-hunt. James Gordon Bennett
of the New York <i>Herald</i>, Gen. Anson Stager of the Western
Union Telegraph, Lawrence R. and Leonard W. Jerome, and
Generals Davis, Fitzhughes, and Rucker, with Sergeant-General
Arsch, Carrol Livingston, and others, formed the party.
Immediately upon their arrival at Fort McPherson General
Sheridan sent for Buffalo Bill, introducing him with flattering
remarks to each one of the hunting-party and telling him
that he was to be their special guide and scout. The party
hunted over a large extent of territory, killing many buffaloes,
turkeys, jack-rabbits, and antelopes, and greatly enjoyed their
visit to the plains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
In 1872 Buffalo Bill was visited by General Forsyth, who
arranged with him a grand buffalo-hunt for the Duke Alexis,
who was then visiting this country. Buffalo Bill at once
conceived the idea of engaging a large number of Indians to
join in the hunt, to make the affair a more pleasurable one
for the grand duke. On the day of the hunt Buffalo Bill
loaned the grand duke his splendid buffalo horse Buckskin
Joe, and riding by his side instructed him in the manner
of shooting buffaloes.</p>

<p>That night in camp numbers of glasses of champagne were
disposed of in drinking to the great success of the Grand Duke
Alexis as a buffalo-hunter. It was soon after the Alexis hunt
that Buffalo Bill received an invitation from James Gordon
Bennett, August Belmont, and others of equal prominence to
visit the East. At the earnest solicitation of General Sheridan
Bill accepted the invitation, and thus it was that he entered
upon the life so different from that in which he had passed
his earlier years.</p>

<p>Attending the theater one night to see a frontier play
bearing his own name&mdash;J.&nbsp;B. Studley taking the character of
Buffalo Bill&mdash;he conceived the idea of going upon the stage
and playing himself, and thus it was that he became an
actor, winning fame and fortune through his enterprises.
Having introduced upon the stage Indians as actors, Buffalo
Bill decided upon reproducing in miniature scenes in wild life
upon the frontier, and from this sprung the Wild West, the
greatest exhibition ever known.</p>

<div id="ip_154" class="figcenter" style="width: 364px;">

  <div class="caption">GENERAL MILES AND BUFFALO BILL VIEWING THE HOSTILES’ VILLAGE IN THE
LAST INDIAN WAR.</div></div>

<p>During his life as an actor and his career as the head of
the Wild West exhibition Buffalo Bill obeyed every call to the
frontier whenever there was any trouble among the Indians, and
at once resumed his duties as scout, guide, and Indian fighter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
winning added laurels thereby and conclusively proving that
through his life in cities his heart, brain, and hand had not
lost their cunning or courage and the nobility of his nature
had not suffered through contact with the world, nor had he
been spoiled by applause and praise.</p>

<p>After the massacre of Custer’s band there was great
activity in military movements in the Northwest, and as chief
of scouts under Merritt, Crook, and other generals Buffalo
Bill’s career was a most brilliant one. During the last Indian
campaign Buffalo Bill’s valuable services were publicly recognized
by Gen. Nelson A. Miles, one of our greatest Indian
fighters, and who so quickly crushed the Indians in their late
rising, when Sitting Bull lost his life.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill is one of the few famous scouts who has justly
won the renown which encircles his name. His exploits
have been so numerous, involving a display of such extraordinary
daring and magnificent nerve, that language can not
exaggerate them. General Sheridan often asserted that
Buffalo Bill had “slain as many Indians as any white man
that ever lived.” It would be no credit to this daring scout
if these Indians had fallen without justification; but since
they were the victims of legitimate warfare and were slain in
the performance of a sworn duty, Buffalo Bill may properly
wear the laurels and deserve the plaudits of civilization&mdash;whose
effective instrument he has been&mdash;for the friendship
he has displayed for the red man in times of peace.</p>

<p>As the noted scout is revealing to the eyes of the whole
world the scenes in which he has been a participant, there are
few indeed who do not care to see the Wild West in miniature
as he portrays it with the aid of his Indians and cowboys,
and give him praise for his phenomenal success. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
produced the Wild West in all the large cities of America,
Buffalo Bill decided, so to speak, to “carry the war into
Africa,” and the result was that with his partner, Mr. Nate
Salisbury, an actor of renown, he invaded first the English
capital, then the other capitals of Europe, his enterprise everywhere
winning the plaudits of royalty, the press, and the
public.</p>

<span class="subhead">BUFFALO BILL’S “PARDS” OF THE PLAINS.</span></h2>

<p>To gain great local and national fame as a plains
celebrity in the days of old was not an easy task; rather
one of the most competitive struggles that a young man could
possibly engage in. The vast, comparatively unknown, even
called great, American Desert of twenty-five and thirty years
ago was peopled only by the descendants of the sturdy pioneers
of the then far West&mdash;Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas,
Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, etc.&mdash;born, raised, and used to hardships
and danger; and attracted only the resolute, determined
adventurers of the rest of the world, seeking an outlet for
pent-up natures imbued with love of daring adventure.
Hundreds of men achieved local, and great numbers national,
fame for the possession of every manly quality that goes to
make up the romantic hero of that once dark and bloody
ground. When it is brought to mind the work engaged in&mdash;the
carving out of the advance paths for the more domestically
inclined settler; of the dangers and excitements of
hunting and trapping; of carrying dispatches, stage-driving,
freighting cargoes of immense value, guiding successfully the
immense wagon-trains, gold-hunting&mdash;it is easy to conceive
what a class of sturdy, adventurous young spirits entered the
arena to struggle in a daily deadly, dangerous game to win
the “bubble reputation.” When such an army of the best
human material battled for supremacy, individual distinction
gained by the unwritten law of unprejudiced <i>popular</i> promotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
possessed a value that made its acquirer a “plains celebrity,”
stamped indelibly with an <i>honored title</i> rarely possessed
unless fairly, openly, and justly won&mdash;a prize so pure that its
ownership, while envied, crowned the victor with the friendship,
following, and admiration of the contestants. Thus
Boone, Crocket, Carson, Beal, Fremont, Cody, Bridger, Kinman,
Hickok, Cosgrove, Comstock, Frank North, and others
will live in the romance, the poetry, and history of their
distinctive work forever. The same spirit and circumstances
have furnished journalists innumerable, who in the West
imbibed the sterling qualities they afterward used to such
effect&mdash;notably, Henry M. Stanley, who (in 1866) saw the
rising sun of the young empire that stretches to the Rockies;
General Greely, of Arctic fame, and the equally
scientific explorer, Lieutenant Schwatka, passed their early
career in the same school, and often followed the trail,
led by Buffalo Bill; Finerty (formerly of the Chicago
<i>Times</i>); “Modoc” Fox and O’Kelly (of the New York <i>Herald</i>),
1876; while of late years the scribblers were initiated
to their baptism of fire by Harries (of Washington <i>Star</i>),
McDonough (New York <i>World</i>), Bailey (of <i>Inter Ocean</i>),
brave young Kelly (of the Lincoln <i>Journal</i>), Cressy (of
the Omaha <i>Bee</i>), Charlie Seymour (Chicago <i>Herald</i>), Allen
(of the New York <i>Herald</i>), Robert J. Boylan (of <i>Inter
Ocean</i>), present in the battle, who were honored by three
cheers from “Old White Top” Forsyth’s gallant Seventh
Cavalry, the day after the battle of “Wounded Knee,” as they
went charging over Wolf Creek&mdash;to what came near being a
crimson day&mdash;to the fight “down at the mission.” That there
are still “successors to every king” is assured by the manly
scouts so prominent in the last Indian war in such men as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Frank Gruard, now the most celebrated of the present
employed army scouts; of “Little Bat,” true as steel and active
as the cougar; Philip Wells, Louis Shangrau, “Big Baptiste,”
and John Shangrau; while the friendly Indians furnish such
grand material for any future necessity as No Neck, Major
Sword, Red Shirt, and Yankton Charley.</p>

<h3>“WILD BILL” (J. B. HICKOK).</h3>

<p>It is a noticeable coincidence that nearly all of the famous
frontier characters are natives of the West, and J.&nbsp;B. Hickok,
better known as Wild Bill, was not an exception to the rule.</p>

<div id="ip_161" class="figcenter" style="width: 247px;">
  <img src="images/i_161.jpg" width="247" height="352" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">WILD BILL.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Born in La Salle County, Illinois, in 1837, his earliest desire
was for horses and firearms. At the age of fourteen he had
become known as a wolf-killer, for at that time the country
where he lived was overrun by them.</p>

<p>Acquiring a rudimental education he started out to earn
his living, and began as a tow-path driver on the Illinois &amp;
Michigan Canal.</p>

<p>Longing for fields of adventure he went into Kansas, where
he soon made a name in the border war then going on there.</p>

<p>It was in Kansas that he was given the name of “Bill,”
though just why no one seems to know; and afterward his
daring and adventurous career got for him the added cognomen
of “Wild Bill,” a name that he certainly made famous.</p>

<p>Serving upon the frontier as wagon-boss, pony-rider, stage-driver,
and then drifting into the position of guide and Government
scout, Wild Bill made a name for himself in each
occupation he followed.</p>

<p>It was while serving as train-boss of one of Russell &amp; Majors
wagon-trains that Wild Bill met and befriended Buffalo Bill,
then a mere boy; and the friendship thus begun ended only
with the death of Hickok, at Deadwood, at the hands of the
assassin Jack McCaul.</p>

<p>A soldier, scout, and spy during the Civil War, Wild Bill
returned to scouting at its close, the frontier becoming his
home.</p>

<p>Constantly he was thrown in the company of Buffalo Bill,
and when the latter decided to go upon the stage he determined
that his companions in the enterprise should be Wild Bill and
Texas Jack, and they accompanied him to the East.</p>

<p>A dead shot, an enemy to fear, Wild Bill was as brave as a
lion and as tender-hearted as a woman, and he will go down in
history as a true hero of the border.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<h3>“TEXAS JACK” (J. B. OMOHUNDRO).</h3>

<p>Known in his native State, Virginia, as John B.
Omohundro, the subject of this sketch won the sobriquet
of “Texas Jack” after service as a ranger in the Lone Star
State.</p>

<div id="ip_163" class="figcenter" style="width: 206px;">
  <img src="images/i_163.jpg" width="206" height="304" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">TEXAS JACK.</div></div>

<p>Reared in a part of Virginia where every man rode a
horse, and born a natural hunter, while his parents were able
to gratify his desire to become a skilled horseman and
expert shot, Jack Omohundro at an early age became
noted among his comrades as a fearless rider and a dead
shot.</p>

<p>When the Civil War broke out, though but a boy, Jack
enlisted in the Confederate cavalry, and during the four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
years saw much hard service and was a participant in many
battles.</p>

<p>Becoming connected with the headquarters of a Texas
general he was made a scout, and as such rendered valuable
services to the Confederate army.</p>

<p>Allied with Texans he went with them to Texas at the
close of the war, going to the frontier, where he joined a
company of rangers.</p>

<p>From ranger, in which capacity he saw much service
against the Indians, he turned to cattle-herding, becoming
first a cowboy and afterward a rancher.</p>

<p>Going northward into Kansas in charge of a large herd of
cattle Texas Jack met, at a frontier post, Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>A warm friendship at once sprung up between the two,
which ended only with the death of the gallant Texan some
years ago at Leadville, Colo.</p>

<p>It was through the agency of Buffalo Bill that Texas Jack
entered the service of the Government as a scout and won
distinction as such, and also as guide and Indian fighter.</p>

<p>As a scout he was respected by army officers for his
skill and courage, and he became the warm friend of “White
Beaver” (Dr. Frank Powell), Maj. Frank North, and Wild
Bill, joining the latter, with Buffalo Bill, in the theatrical
enterprise which Buffalo Bill continued until he originated
the Wild West exhibition.</p>

<h3>DR. D. FRANK POWELL (“WHITE BEAVER”).</h3>

<div id="ip_164" class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
  <img src="images/i_165.jpg" width="229" height="303" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">DR. D. FRANK POWELL (“WHITE BEAVER.”)</div></div>

<p>The life of “White Beaver” (Dr. D. Frank Powell) bears all
the colors and shades of an idyllic romance. His character
stands out upon the canvas of human eccentricities in striking
originality, and never finds its counterpart save in stories of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
knight-errantry, when hearts, names, and titles were the prizes
bestowed for daring deeds evolved from generous sentiments.
His has been the tenor of uneven ways, with characteristics
as variable as the gifts in Pandora’s box. A born plainsman,
with the rough, rugged marks of wild and checkered incident,
and yet a mind that feeds on fancy, builds images of refinement,
and looks out through the windows of his soul upon
visions of purity and fields elysian. A reckless adventurer on
the boundless prairies, and yet in elegant society as amiable
as a school-girl in the ball-room; evidencing the polish of
an aristocrat, and a cultured mind that shines with vigorous
luster where learning displays itself. A friend to be valued
most in direst extremity, and an enemy with implacable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
insatiable, and revengeful animosities. In short, he is a
singular combination of opposites, and yet the good in him so
predominates over his passions that no one has more valuable
friendships and associations than these strange complexities
attract to him. He is an ideal hero, the image which rises
before the ecstatic vision of a romancer, and he impresses
himself upon the millions who know his reputation as a brave
and chivalrous gentleman.</p>

<p>A description of White Beaver is not difficult to give,
because of his striking features; those who see him once are
so impressed with his bearing that his image is never
forgotten. He is almost six feet in height, of large frame
and giant muscular development; a full round face, set off
by a Grecian nose, a handsome mouth, and black eyes of
penetrating brilliancy. His hair is long and hangs over his
shoulders in raven ringlets. In action he is marvelously
quick, always decisive, and his endurance almost equals that
of a steam-engine. His appearance is that of a resolute,
high-toned gentleman, conscious of his power, and yet his
deference, I may say amiability, attracts every one to him.
He is, in short, one of the handsomest as well as most
powerful men among the many great heroes of the plains.</p>

<p>In addition to his other qualifications peculiarly fitting him
for a life on the plains, he is an expert pistol and rifle shot; in
fact, there are perhaps not a half-dozen persons in the United
States who are his superiors; his precision is not so great now
as it once was, for the reason that during the past three or four
years he has had but very little practice; but even now he
would be regarded an expert among the most skillful. For
dead-center shooting at stationary objects he never had a
superior. His eyesight is more acute than an eagle’s, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
enables him to distinguish and hit the head of a pin ten paces
distant, and this shot he can perform now nine times out of
ten. Any of his office employes will hold a copper cent
between their fingers and let him shoot it out at ten paces, so
great is their confidence in his skill; he also shoots through
finger-rings held in the same manner. One very pretty fancy-shot
he does is splitting a bullet on a knife-blade; he also
suspends objects by a hair, and at ten paces cuts the hair,
which of course he can not see, but shoots by judgment.
Several persons have told me that they have seen him shoot a
fish-line in two while it was being dragged swiftly through the
water.</p>

<p>White Beaver and Buffalo Bill have been bosom friends
and fellow-plainsmen since boyhood. History records no
love between two men greater than that of these two foster-brothers.</p>

<h3>MAJ. FRANK J. NORTH.</h3>

<p>This gallant officer was universally recognized as one of
the best executive leaders and bravest men that ever faced the
dangers of the plains.</p>

<p>Although born in the State of New York (March 10,
1840), he was by virtue of his training a thorough Westerner.
While still a boy his father moved from New York to near
Columbus in the State of Nebraska, and very soon thereafter
was frozen to death at Emigrant Crossing, on Big Papillion
Creek, while searching for wood for his suffering family.
After a short connection with McMurra, Glass, and Messenger,
a party of trappers, he returned to Columbus and turned his
hand to anything that offered.</p>

<p>In 1860, at the age of twenty years, he procured employment
with Agent De Puy, at the Pawnee Indian Reservation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
While there he studied and became thoroughly proficient in
the Pawnee language, and in the following year was engaged
as interpreter by Mr. Rudy, son-in-law of the Indian Commissioner.</p>

<p>In 1864, when the Sioux war broke out, he was commissioned
by General Curtis to organize the Pawnee Scouts. He
formed a company of seventy-seven young warriors, and was
made first lieutenant. To Major North belongs the honor of
making the first enlistment of Indians for regular Government
service. In October following Lieutenant North
supplemented his first enlistment by another of 100
Pawnee warriors, who were equipped as regular cavalry, and
he was promoted to the rank of captain.</p>

<p>In January, 1865, Captain North, with forty of his Pawnee
braves, started in pursuit of the Sioux, who had been committing
terrible outrages in the neighborhood of Julesburg.
Death and destruction marked the trail of the Sioux, and
Captain North arrived at Julesburg just in time to rescue its
inhabitants. Still pursuing, he caught up with a party of
twenty-eight of the red devils, and not one of them escaped
his vengeance. This was a part of Red Cloud’s forces, and
only a few days before they had suddenly attacked Lieutenant
Collins and fourteen men and massacred the entire
party.</p>

<p>Shortly after this he became the hero of one of the most
daring fights ever recorded. During the pursuit of a party of
twelve Cheyennes, with the intention of punishing them for
atrocities committed in the neighborhood of Fort Sedgwick,
his impetuous ardor was so great that it led him far in advance
of his followers. He suddenly realized that he was at least a
mile ahead of his men. After bringing down one of the fleeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Cheyennes he turned to rejoin his command. Seeing him
alone the Indians started in pursuit, and his horse having
been killed he was compelled to continue his retreat on foot.
After having gone some distance he remembered he had left
two loaded revolvers in the holsters on his saddle, and notwithstanding
the danger he boldly returned for them, and
with them fought the Cheyennes single-handed for nearly half
an hour longer, until relieved by Lieutenant Small.</p>

<p>In 1865&ndash;66, after the Pawnees were mustered out of service,
Captain North was appointed post trader at the Pawnee
Reservation.</p>

<p>In the March following, under orders from General Auger,
he raised a battalion of 200 Pawnees, who were equipped for
cavalry service and taken to Fort Kearney, he being commissioned
a major. This battalion guarded construction trains
on the Union Pacific Railroad until it reached Ogden.</p>

<p>Upon the completion of the road Major North retired to a
ranch on Dismal River, near North Platte, where he went into
the cattle-raising business. He was then a great sufferer from
asthma, and had abandoned all hope of relief.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill and Major North met for the first time at Fort
McPherson, and served together in several campaigns. They
became very warm friends, and afterward partners in the
cattle business under the firm name of Cody &amp; North.</p>

<p>Major North, besides being a remarkable Indian fighter
and a phenomenally brave man, was a thorough gentleman, of
generous and noble instincts, an honest friend, and popular
with all classes. His death a few years ago at North Platte
was deeply and sincerely regretted by the many who had
known and loved him well. To none did the news cause
more sincere regret than to his old “pard” and partner,
Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<h3>SITTING BULL.</h3>

<div id="ip_170" class="figcenter" style="width: 291px;">
  <img src="images/i_170.jpg" width="291" height="419" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">SITTING BULL.</div></div>

<p>Though nearly a score of years have gone by since the
battle of the Little Big Horn, where the gallant Custer and
his brave band were slain, the name of Sitting Bull is recalled
by all; and a sigh of relief went up all along the border when
the news came that the noted chief had started upon the
trail for the happy hunting-grounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Those who condemn the Indian for his red deeds should
remember that it is his education to be a savage, to kill and
to burn and pillage; that the greatest slayer of mankind, in
the opinion of the red men, is the greatest hero.</p>

<p>Thus, considering that the Indian has his story to tell as
well as the white man, the mantle of charity should be drawn
over their deeds.</p>

<p>Sitting Bull was not a chief in the true sense of the word,
but was the Moses of his people.</p>

<p>He had unlimited influence with his tribe, and among
other tribes as well; and, a mighty medicine-man, he claimed
as well to be a prophet.</p>

<p>The career of Sitting Bull was eventful and remarkable.</p>

<p>He was a leader and schemer, and when Generals Terry,
Crook, and Gibbon were sent to capture him he showed great
generalship in all that he did.</p>

<p>He checked the advance of General Crook, slaughtered
Custer, and escaped into Canada, where he and his people
were safe.</p>

<p>In 1877 a part of Sitting Bull’s tribe surrendered to General
Miles, who pressed them so hard they could not escape into
Canada.</p>

<p>In 1880 others of the tribe surrendered to General Miles
at Fort Keogh, and later Sitting Bull and others surrendered
to keep from starving. They were transferred to Standing
Rock Agency.</p>

<p>Sitting Bull received tempting offers to go East on exhibition,
but refused all except one from Buffalo Bill&mdash;whom he
knew as a deadly foe in warfare and a good friend in times of
peace&mdash;and so went with some of his people to join the Wild
West, with which he remained for a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
The killing of Sitting Bull is still fresh in the minds of
the people, and his taking off has been condemned by many.</p>

<p>At the time of his death Buffalo Bill, Surgeon Frank
Powell, Pony Bob Haslam, and others were on their way to
his camp to demand his surrender. Had Buffalo Bill not
been halted by the command of the President and had reached
Sitting Bull’s camp, the great chief would not have been
slain; and probably Cody’s influence would have been strong
enough to have changed to a more peaceful settlement the
emeute that culminated in Wounded Knee and Pine Ridge.</p>

<h3>“OKLAHOMA PAYNE” (CAPT. D. L. PAYNE), THE CIMARRON SCOUT.</h3>

<p>David L. Payne, known throughout the West as Captain
Payne, of the Oklahoma Colony Company, was born in Grant
County, Indiana, December 30, 1836. In 1858, with his
brother, he started West, intending to engage in the Mormon
War, but reached there too late. He settled in Doniphan
County, Texas. His commercial pursuits there not resulting
in success he turned hunter, and so became thoroughly
acquainted with the topography of the great Southwest.
Afterward a scout, he was often engaged in that capacity
by the Government and by private expeditions. In this
way he became acquainted with Kit Carson, Wild Bill,
Buffalo Bill, California Joe, General Custer, and others of
national reputation.</p>

<p>During the Civil War he served as a private in the Fourth
Regiment, which was afterward merged into the Tenth. In
the fall of 1864 he was elected to the Kansas Legislature.
Upon its adjournment he again enlisted, and his command
was detailed for duty at Washington City. His service in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
the volunteer army covered a period of eight years, his last
position being captain of Company H, Nineteenth Kansas
Cavalry, from October, 1868, to October, 1869. During these
eight years he held the positions of postmaster at Fort
Leavenworth, member of the Legislature, and sergeant-at-arms
of the Kansas Senate.</p>

<div id="ip_173" class="figcenter" style="width: 291px;">
  <img src="images/i_173.jpg" width="291" height="293" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">BRIGADIER-GENERAL GEORGE A. CUSTER.</div></div>

<p>At the close of the war Captain Payne returned to the
life of the plains, and in the spring of 1868 he accompanied
General Custer in an expedition against the Cheyennes,
during which he, with two others, was detailed as special
messenger to Fort Hays to secure assistance, and in that
capacity encountered great dangers and privations.</p>

<p>In 1870 he removed to Sedgwick County, Kansas, near
Wichita, and in the following year was again elected to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Legislature. In 1879 he became interested in a movement
for the occupation and settlement of a district in the Indian
Territory which is known as Oklahoma (beautiful land). In
1880 he organized a colony for the purpose of entering upon
and settling these lands, but was stopped by a decision of
Carl Schurz, then Secretary of the Interior, to the effect that
these lands were open to settlement only to negroes or Indians.
Owing to the arrest of Captain Payne by the United States
authorities the colony disbanded.</p>

<p>However historians may differ as to the wisdom or
legality of Captain Payne’s so-called Oklahoma invasion
and the court’s decisions upon the subject, the fact remains
that his name is held high in honor and esteem by the older
citizens of the now flourishing Oklahoma&mdash;a monument to his
forethought.</p>

<h3>NATHAN SALSBURY.</h3>

<p>Now to one who if not a “pard” of the plains is a partner
in the Wild West.</p>

<div id="ip_175" class="figcenter" style="width: 359px;">
  <img src="images/i_174.jpg" width="359" height="561" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">

<p>
Yours Truly<br />
Nate Salsbury<br />
</p></div></div>

<p>Mr. Nate Salsbury, the partner of Buffalo Bill in his business
enterprise of the Wild West, and his devoted friend, was
born in Freeport, Ill., his parents being in humble circumstances.
Nate Salsbury began to work for a living at an
early age, his ambition being to win fame and fortune by
becoming a self-made man. As there was little to bind his
affections to the home of his nativity, when the war broke
out, with all the patriotism of an American stirring in his
bosom, he enlisted as a private in the Fifteenth Illinois Regiment,
though but a boy in years. His career as a boy soldier
won for him praise and promotion, and he was wounded in
battle on three different occasions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Made a prisoner by the Confederates, he was incarcerated
in Andersonville prison, where he remained for seven months.</p>

<p>Being at length exchanged, he returned to his home and
began the study of law. A few months of office work and
attendance at school, as well, impressed him with the idea
that the legal profession would still have a fairly large membership,
even though his name was not added to the list.
Abandoning his intention of becoming a lawyer, and while
attending school he was selected for a part in an amateur theatrical
performance. From the time that he made his first bow
to an audience before the footlights as an amateur, he was
seized with the irresistible desire to become an actor. With
Nate Salsbury to decide was to act, and going to Grand Rapids,
Mich., with only a few dollars in his pocket, he received a position
which, though humble, gave him a start in professional life.
After a short season there he went East and secured a position
in the Boston Museum Company, where his histrionic talent
was quickly recognized by the management. His success at
this theater soon attracted to him the attention of managers of
other cities, and he accepted the position of leading man at
Hooley’s Theater in Chicago. His progress was thenceforth
rapid. His popularity grew apace and his salary was added
to with every engagement. There was too much originality
in Nate Salsbury to allow of his remaining a member of a
stock company, so he conceived and constructed a comedy
entertainment to which he gave the title of “The Troubadours.”</p>

<p>From the first production of “The Troubadours” the fame
and fortune of Nate Salsbury were assured. His play of
“Patchwork” followed, then his most successful comedy, “The
Brook,” which added largely to his riches and his name as
an actor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
Mr. Salsbury went with his Troubadours in a trip around
the world, everywhere receiving deserved praise, and he was
the first dramatic manager who made this hazardous tour
with his own company.</p>

<p>The tour took the Troubadours&mdash;after going all over the
United States, playing from Maine to Texas, the Carolinas to
California&mdash;through Australia, India, Scotland, England, Ireland,
and Wales, wherever the English tongue was spoken.</p>

<p>Meeting Buffalo Bill and learning from him his intention
of giving wild Western exhibitions, Mr. Salsbury became a
partner in the Wild West, and took the active management
of that gigantic aggregation, withdrawing from the
stage to do so.</p>

<p>During the tour of Buffalo Bill abroad, at many dinners
and assemblages Mr. Nate Salsbury’s oratorical powers,
mimic skill, ready wit, recitative talent, and facility of expressing
sentiment delighted all who heard him, and invariably
made an impression that will long keep his memory green,
while the reputation of Americans for oratory was well
sustained by the prairie-born boy soldier.</p>

<p>As a proof of Mr. Salsbury’s nerve under trying circumstances,
he was about to go upon the stage at Denver when
he received a dispatch from his partner, Buffalo Bill, which
told him that the Wild West steamer on the Mississippi had
collided with another boat and sunk. Buffalo Bill telegraphed,
“The whole outfit at the bottom of the Mississippi River.
What do you advise?” Without an instant’s hesitation Nate
Salsbury wrote on a telegraph blank this answer, “Go to
New Orleans, reorganize, and open on your date,” and this
Buffalo Bill did.</p>

<p>Some years ago Mr. Salsbury invested heavily in the cattle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
business in Montana, and to-day owns one of the most valuable
ranches in the Northwest. It was during his visit to his
ranch that he saw the practicability of an exhibition such as
the Wild West, and readily joined Buffalo Bill in the enterprise.
A man of brains, a strict disciplinarian, a genial gentleman,
with genius to originate and ability to accomplish,
generous and courageous, Nate Salsbury stands to-day unrivaled
as an executive of great amusement enterprises, and he
thoroughly deserves the fortune and fame that he has won.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">You bet I know him, pardner, he ain’t no circus fraud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s Western born and Western bred, if he has been late abroad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew him in the days way back, beyond Missouri’s flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the country round was nothing but a huge Wild Western Show;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the Injuns were as thick as fleas, and the man who ventured through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sandhills of Nebraska had to fight the hostile Sioux.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These were hot times, I tell you; and we all remember still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The days when Cody was a scout, and all the men knew Bill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">I knew him first in Kansas in the days of ’68,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the Cheyennes and Arapahoes were wiping from the slate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old scores against the settlers, and when men who wore the blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shoulder-straps and way-up rank, were glad to be helped through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a bearer of dispatches, who knew each vale and hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Dakota down to Texas, and his other name was Bill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">I mind me too of ’79, the time when Cody took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His scouts upon the Rosebud, along with General Crook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Custer’s Seventh rode to their death for lack of some such aid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell them that the sneaking Sioux knew how to ambuscade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw Bill’s fight with Yellow Hand, you bet it was a “mill”;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He downed him well at thirty yards, and all the men cheered Bill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">They tell me that the women folk now take his word as laws;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In them days laws were mighty skerce, and hardly passed with squaws;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But many a hardy settler’s wife and daughter used to rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More quietly because they knew of Cody’s dauntless breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because they felt, from Laramie way down to old Fort Sill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bill Cody was a trusted scout, and all their men knew Bill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">I haven’t seen him much of late; how does he bear his years?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They says he’s making ducats now, from shows and not from “steers”;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He used to be a judge of “horns,” when poured in a tin cup,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left the wine to tenderfeet, and men who felt “way up”;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps he cracks a bottle now, perhaps he’s had his fill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who cares, Bill Cody was a scout, and all the world knows Bill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">To see him in his trimmins, he can’t hardly look the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With laundered shirt and diamonds, as if “he run a game.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He didn’t wear biled linen then, or flash up diamond rings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The royalties he dreamed of then were only pasteboard kings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But those who sat behind the queens were apt to get their fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the days when Cody was a scout, and all the men knew Bill.<br /></span>

<h3>BUFFALO CHIPS, THE SCOUT, TO BUFFALO BILL.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></h3>

<p>[The following verses on the life and death of poor old Buffalo Chips
are founded entirely on facts. His death occurred on September 8, 1876,
at Slim Buttes. He was within three feet of me when he fell, uttering the
words credited to him below.&mdash;Capt. <span class="smcap">Jack Crawford</span>, Poet Scout.]</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The evenin’ sun war settin’, droppin’ slowly in the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ the soldiers, tired an’ tuckered, in the camp would find that rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which the settin’ sun would bring ’em, for they’d marched since break o’ day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a bite to eat ’cept horses as war killed upon the way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ye see our beans an’ crackers an’ our pork were outen sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ the boys expected rashuns when they struck our camp that night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a little hand had started for to bring some cattle on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ they struck an Indian village, which they captured just at dawn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wall, I were with that party when we captured them ar’ Sioux,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ we quickly sent a courier to tell old Crook the news.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Crook! I should say gen’l, cos he war with the boys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shared his only hard-tack, our sorrows, and our joys;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ thar is one thing sartin&mdash;he never put on style;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’d greet the scout or soldier with a social kinder smile.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ that’s the kind o’ soldier as the prairy likes to get,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ every man would trump Death’s ace for Crook or Miles, you bet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But I’m kinder off the racket, cos these gener’ls get enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’ praise ’ithout my chippin’, so I’ll let up on that puff;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fer I want to tell a story ’bout a mate of mine as fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cos I loved the honest fellar, and he did his dooty well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buffalo Chips we call’d him, but his other name war White;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ll tell ye how he got that name, an’ reckon I am right.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see a lot of big-bugs an’ officers came out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One time to hunt the buffaler an’ fish fer speckled trout.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wall, little Phil, ye’ve heerd on him, a dainty little cuss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As rode his charger twenty miles to stop a little muss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, Phil he said ter Johnathin, whose other name war White,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“You go an’ find them buffaler, an’ see you get ’em right.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So White he went an’ found ’em, an’ he found ’em sech a band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he sed would set ’em crazy, an’ little Phil looked bland;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the outfit halted, one bull was all war there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Phil he call him “Buffalo Chips,” an’ swore a little swear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wall, White he kinder liked it, cos the gener’l called him Chips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ he us’ter wear two shooters in a belt above his hips.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he said, “Now, look ye, gener’l, since ye’ve called me that ar’ name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jist around them little sandhills is yer dog-gone pesky game!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the hunt war over, an’ the table spread for lunch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gener’l called for glasses, an’ wanted his in punch;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ when the punch was punished, the gener’l smacked his lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While squar’ upon the table sot a dish o’ <i>buffalo chips</i>.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The gener’l looked confounded, an’ he also looked for White,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Johnathin he reckon’d it war better he should lite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he skinned across the prairy, cos ye see he didn’t mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A <i>chippin’</i> any longer while the gener’l saw the <i>blind</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fer the gener’l would <i>a raised him</i>, if he’d jist held up his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he thought he wouldn’t <i>see him</i>, cos he didn’t hev the sand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ he rode as fast&mdash;aye, faster&mdash;than the gener’l did that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like lightin’ down from Winchester some twenty miles away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wall, White he had no cabin, an’ no home to call his own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Buffaler Bill he took him an’ shared with him his home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ how he loved Bill Cody! By gosh! it war a sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ter see him watch his shadder an’ foller him at night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cos Bill war kinder hated by a cussed gang o’ thieves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As carried pistols in thar belts, an’ bowies in thar sleeves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ Chips he never left him, for fear he’d get a pill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor would he think it mighty hard to die for Buffalo Bill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We us’ter mess together, that ar’ Chips an’ Bill an’ me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ ye oughter watch his movements; it would do ye good ter see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How he us’ter cook them wittles, an’ gather lots o’ greens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mix up with the juicy pork an’ them unruly beans.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ one cold chilly mornin’ he bought a lot o’ corn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An’ a little flask o’ likker, as cost fifty cents a horn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho’ <i>forty yards</i> war nowhar, it was finished soon, ye bet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, friends, I <i>promised some one</i>, and I’m strong teetotal yet.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That thar lives sich a rooster as I am;<br /></span>

<span class="subhead">FROM PRAIRIE TO PALACE.</span></h2>

<p>In olden times, when a great leader of an “army with
banners” was about to depart for a foreign country, bent on
conquest, great was the outpouring of the people; loud sounded
the drum and fife, and gay bunting flirted with the joyous
breeze; salvos of artillery and great shouting rent the air, and
songs were sung in honor of the mighty host decked in all the
glittering panoply of war. All this in anticipation of the spoils
of conquest to be brought back by the victor&mdash;human prisoners,
coffers of gold, or blood-bought titles to war-won territory.
How different in spirit, in action, and in expression was the
assemblage that bade “God speed” to Gen. W.&nbsp;F. Cody on his
departure as commander of the little heterogeneous army that
sailed from Columbia’s shores. Yet no leader ever started
on a mission possible of such rich achievement; none ever
embarked upon a voyage destined to be so thoroughly and
completely a tour of conquest and of glory. His project
included neither the shedding of blood, the conquest of territory,
nor the enslaving of prisoners. His was the mission of
peace; the awakening of the Old World to the contemplation
of fresh truths in the picturesque history of the New. Columbus
had told old Spain of the savages that greeted him on his
landing upon the shores of the New World; the Pilgrim
Fathers had sent messages of their terrible struggles with their
bitter Indian foes; but General Cody took with him great
chieftains who called him friend. As evidences and traditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
of the past, and for the delectation of peasant and prince
“across the water,” they danced their war-dance and sounded
their war-whoop. But to the thoughtful it must have been a
grander sight to see them, in the hours not devoted to duty,
grouped in friendly conclave around the man who, appearing
first among them as a foe, they had learned at last to understand
and appreciate as their friend indeed. What a lesson to power,
what an exemplification of the true spirit that moved the
founders of the great American Republic! No compulsion
was used by this hero of the plains to enforce the attendance
of these bronzed warriors on his journeys; but trusting to his
word alone as the guerdon of their safety, they willingly,
gladly, went into a far country among scenes and people
strangely new to them.</p>

<div id="ip_191" class="figcenter" style="width: 553px;">
  <img src="images/i_190.jpg" width="553" height="330" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE PRAIRIE HOME OF BUFFALO BILL.</div></div>

<p>How appropriate that such an army, under such a leader,
and on such a peaceful and glorious invasion, should carry into
and plant in sturdy England, sunny France, historic Spain,
mighty Germany, and poetic Italy the flag that proclaims to
all the world that “all men are, and by right ought to be, free
and equal.”</p>

<p>Before following the Wild West of America in a mimic
display across the seas into foreign lands, it may be well to
here consider something that this wonderful man among men
has done in the way of educating our own and other people
into knowing what the Indian really is.</p>

<p>Glancing now over the history of the Indians, we recall
how cruel has been their mode of warfare, and massacres
innumerable rise up before us, from the red scene in the
Wyoming Valley to the death of the gallant Custer and his
brave 300 boys in blue.</p>

<p>Yet, reared upon the frontier, amid scenes of courage, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
learning from actual experience all the redskin could become
as a foe, Buffalo Bill yet accorded to them the rights that
others would not allow.</p>

<p>If fighting them, he yet would befriend them in time of
need and was never merciless to them in defeat.</p>

<p>Winning fame as scout, guide, and Indian fighter, Buffalo
Bill was seized upon as a hero for the pen of the novelist,
and volumes have been written founded upon his deeds of
daring.</p>

<p>Then, like a meteor, he flashed upon the people of the
East, impersonating upon the stage none other than himself,
living over before the footlights his own life.</p>

<p>Men who have criticised Buffalo Bill as an actor forget
wholly that he is the only man who is <i>playing himself</i>.</p>

<p>He plays his part as he knows it, as he has acted it upon
many a field, acting naturally and without bombast and forced
tragic effect.</p>

<p>Be the motive what it may, love of lucre or the gratification
of pride, the fact still remains that in his delineation of
border life Buffalo Bill educated the people to seeing the
hated and ever-dreaded red men in another light.</p>

<p>He was their friend in peace, not their foe always because
once upon their trail; and he brought the red man before the
public in a way never witnessed before.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill never was a man-killer, and there was nothing
of bravado in his nature and not a tinge of the desperado.</p>

<p>Brought face to face with the stern reality that either his
foe or himself must die, when it was in the discharge of duty
or self-defense William Cody never quailed in the face of
death, and acted, as his conscience dictated, for the right.</p>

<p>But his stage experience gave William Cody the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
of producing border life upon a grander scale than could be
done within the walls of a theater, and from this sprang the
Wild West exhibitions that have delighted the world.</p>

<p>Conceiving the idea of presenting border life as it was
before vast audiences, he at once carried the thought into
execution, and Buffalo Bill’s Wild West became the center
of attraction wherever it appeared.</p>

<p>After several times swinging around the circle in this
country, the Wild West crossed the ocean in a steamship
chartered to carry the vast aggregation, and landed upon the
shores of England.</p>

<p>Behold the result! Opening in London before vast
audiences, the queen, the Prince of Wales, and other royal
personages of high rank flocked to see the man and those he
had brought with him into the very heart of the English
metropolis.</p>

<p>There, upon the soil of the mother country, before
tens of thousands of Britishers, the Wild West held sway for
months, while the hero of the plains, the prairie boy, found
himself honored by royalty, a welcome visitor across the
threshold of palaces, fêted by men whose names were known
the wide world over.</p>

<p>Bearing the stars and stripes in his hand, mounted upon
his finest charger, Buffalo Bill saluted the queen, who rose,
and bowed in salutation to the American flag, borne by so fit
a representative of his country.</p>

<p>Nor did the triumphal march of the Wild West end here, for
Buffalo Bill sought other lands to conquer, and bore the stars
and stripes into France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Belgium,
and elsewhere, presenting the American flag before more
peoples than it had ever been seen by during its existence of
a century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Traveling through Europe with three railway trains of
seventy-five cars, carrying over three hundred people, with
the horses of our plains, the buffaloes, and wild steers, the Wild
West was the observed of all observers, and crowned heads
everywhere gave Buffalo Bill, his cowboys, and Indians a welcome,
even his holiness the pope granting them an audience.</p>

<p>Living in their own camp, eating American food, the people
of the Wild West did much to educate foreigners into a taste
for American hams, corn-meal, and other luxuries; and it was
through the sending of so much corn to Cody’s commissary
that Colonel Murphy of the Department of Agriculture won
the name of “Corn-meal Murphy.”</p>

<p>From this explanatory sketch the reader can readily see
how it was that Buffalo Bill went from the prairie to the
palace.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those of my readers who are interested
in the study of physiognomy, I submit the following physiognomical
study of Colonel Cody by Prof. A.&nbsp;J. Oppenheim,
B.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;A., of London:</p>

<p>“The length from the opening of the ear to the outer
corner of the eye shows great intellectual capacity and quickness
of comprehension. The forehead is broad, square, and
practical. The deep setting of the eyes in their sockets
denotes great shrewdness and keenness of perception. The
fullness under the eye means eloquence and the faculty of
verbal expression. The downward projection of the outer
corner of the eyebrows means contest&mdash;he never gives in.
The unevenness of the hair of the eyebrows shows hastiness
of temper and irritability when under restraint, but the
straightness of the eyebrows themselves denotes truthfulness
and sincerity. The height of the facial bone generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
indicates great intensity and strong powers of physical endurance.
The ridge in the center of the nose means relative
defense, protection, quixotism, taking up other people’s
cudgels and fighting their battles for them. The thinness of
the bridge of the nose denotes generosity and love of spending
money. Colonel Cody might make many fortunes, but he
would never succeed in amassing one. The length of the
nostrils shows activity; the manner in which they dilate and
curl, pride; and their size denotes courage and fearlessness.
The transparency of the eyelids and the fineness of the eyelashes
is indicative of a keenly sensitive, sympathetic, and
benevolent nature. Though a large-sized man, and a great
warrior, his heart is as tender as a woman’s. The angle of
the jaw denotes determination and strength of purpose, but
the narrowness of the lower part of the face suggests a complete
absence of coarseness or brutality. The length of the
throat shows a marvelous independence of spirit and love
of fresh air and exercise. The wavy lines in the forehead
mean hope and enthusiasm; the two perpendicular ones
between the eyes, love of equity and justice.”</p>

<p>To-day Buffalo Bill stands as a typical plainsman, the last
of a race of men whose like will never be seen again.</p>

<p>The trackless wilderness, the arid deserts, mountains, and
plains are to-day as an open book through the work of just
such pioneers of the star of empire as is Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>They have solved the mysteries of the unknown land of
the setting sun as it was half a century ago, and then sprang
into existence as educators, and having done their work well
are awaiting the last call to that great terra incognita beyond
the river of death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Their like will never be seen again on this earth, for there
are no new lands to explore.</p>

<p>As Columbus was the pilot across the seas to discover a
new world, such heroes as Boone, Fremont, Crockett, Kit
Carson, and last, but by no means least, Cody, were the
guides to the New World of the mighty West, and their
names will go down in history as</p>

<span class="subhead">THE WILD WEST AT SEA.</span></h2>

<p>The Wild West visited many of the principal cities of this
country, played a winter season in New Orleans, a summer
season at Staten Island, and the winter of 1886&ndash;87 in Madison
Square Garden in New York. But with the immortal bard
who wrote “ambition grows with what it feeds on,” Colonel
Cody and Mr. Salsbury had an ambition to conquer other
nations. The importance of the undertaking was fully realized,
but nothing daunted by all that would have to be undergone
to reach a foreign land and give exhibitions, the owners
of the Wild West boldly made the venture.</p>

<p>The writer went abroad and arranged to play a season of
six months in London, as an adjunct of the American exhibition.
All arrangements being made, the Indians were secured,
the representative types of the Sioux, Cheyennes, Kiowas,
Pawnees, and Ogalallas, and a number of prominent chiefs.</p>

<p>Having collected a company of more than two hundred
men and animals, consisting of Indians, cowboys, Mexican
riders, rifle-shots, buffaloes, Texas steers, burros, broncos,
racing-horses, elk, bear, and an immense amount of paraphernalia
such as tents, wagons, stage-coach, arms, ammunition,
costumes, and all equipage necessary, the steamship City
of Nebraska, Captain Braes, was chartered. The City of
Nebraska, loaded with the Wild West, set sail from New
York, Thursday, March 31, 1887. The piers were crowded
with thousands of good friends who went down to wave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
adieux and to wish the Wild West a pleasant voyage and
success.</p>

<p>As the steamship City of Nebraska pulled out of the
dock the cowboy band played “The Girl I Left Behind Me”
in a manner that suggested more reality than empty sentiment
in the familiar air. Before starting on the trip a
number of the Indians had expressed grave fears about
trusting themselves upon the mighty ocean, fearing that a
dreadful death would soon overtake them, and it required
much persuasion at the last moment to induce them to go on
board.</p>

<p>Red Shirt explained that these fears were caused by a
superstitious belief that if a red man attempted to cross the
ocean he would be seized of a malady that would first prostrate
the victim and then slowly consume his flesh, until at
length the very skin itself would drop from his bones, leaving
nothing but the skeleton, and this even would never find
burial. This weird belief was repeated by the chiefs of
several tribes to the Indians who had joined the Wild West,
so there was little reason for wonder that the poor children of
the forest should hesitate to submit themselves to such an
experiment. On the day following the departure from New
York the Indians began to grow weary, and becoming seasick
they were both treacherous and rebellious. Their fears
were greatly intensified as even Red Shirt, the bravest of his
people, looked anxiously toward the hereafter, and began to
feel his flesh to see if it was really diminishing. The hopelessness
stamped upon the faces of the Indians was
pitiful to behold, and but for the endeavors of Buffalo Bill
to cheer them up and relieve their forebodings there is no
knowing what might have happened. But for two days the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
whole company, Indians, cowboys, and all, did little other
active service than to feed the fishes.</p>

<p>On the third day all began to grow better, and the Indians
were called into the salon and given a sermon by Buffalo
Bill; Red Shirt also, having lost his anxiety, joining in the
oratory.</p>

<p>After the seasickness was over, Mr. Salsbury, as singer and
comedian, took an active part in amusing all on board. The
seventh day of the voyage a fierce storm swept over the sea,
and the ship was forced to lay to, and during its continuance
the stock suffered greatly; but only one horse died on the
trip. At last the steamship cast anchor off Gravesend, and a
tugboat loaded with custom-house and quarantine officers
boarded to make the usual inspection. The English government,
through its officials, extended every courtesy. A
special permit was given for the animals to land, and the
people started for the camp.</p>

<p>The arrival of the City of Nebraska had been watched
for with great curiosity, as a number of yachts, tugboats,
and other craft surrounding it testified. A tug was soon
seen flying the Stars and Stripes, and as it came nearer the
strains of “The Star Spangled Banner,” rendered by the band
on her deck, floated across the water. As the welcome strains
ended, the cowboy band on the Nebraska responded with
“Yankee Doodle.” When the tug came alongside, the company
on board proved to be the directors of the American
exhibition in London, with Lord Ronald Gower heading a
distinguished committee and representatives of the leading
journals of England.</p>

<p>As Buffalo Bill landed with the committee three cheers
were given, and cries rang out of “Welcome to old England,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
giving pleasing evidence of the public interest that had been
awakened through the coming of the Wild West. A special
train with saloon carriages was waiting to convey the party to
London, and leaving behind them the old Kentish town, in an
hour after they arrived at Victoria Station.</p>

<p>Entering the headquarters of the exhibition Buffalo Bill
and those who accompanied him found a bounteous repast
set, and a generous welcome was accorded them. After brief
social converse a visit was made to the grounds, where
hundreds of busy workmen were hastening the completion
of the arena, the grand-stand, and stabling for the cattle.
When it is taken into consideration that these operations were
dealing with an expenditure of over one hundred and thirty
thousand dollars, the greatness of the enterprise can be understood.
An arena of more than a third of a mile in circumference,
flanked by a grand-stand filled with seats and boxes to
accommodate 20,000 persons, sheltered stands for 10,000 more,
the standing-room being 10,000, will give an idea of the size
of the Wild West exhibition grounds.</p>

<p>The interest evinced by the British workmen in the coming
of the Wild West people was as a straw indicating which
way the wind blew, or intended to blow. On the following
morning, when the tide was at its flood, the City of Nebraska
steamed up the river, the trip being a pleasure to all on board.
With the assistance of the horsemen, each looking after his
own horse, the unloading was begun and carried on with a
rapidity that astonished even the old dock-hands and officials.
Through the courtesy of the custom-house people there was
hardly a moment’s delay in the debarkation; but although
landing in London, the Wild West was still twelve miles away
from its city camp. Loading the entire outfit on two trains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
it was speedily delivered at the Midland Railway Depot adjoining
the grounds, and by 4 o’clock on the same afternoon the
horses and other animals had been stabled, watered, and fed,
and the camp equipage and bedding distributed. The camp
cooks were preparing the evening meal, tents were going up,
stoves being erected, tables spread and set in the open air,
tepees erected, and by 6 o’clock a perfect canvas city had
sprung up in the heart of West End London.</p>

<p>Upon the flag-staff the starry banner had been run up and
was floating in the breeze, and the cowboy band rendering
the national airs of America, amid the shouts and cheers of
thousands who lined the walls, streets, and housetops of the
surrounding neighborhood. This was most gratifying to the
newcomers, and in answer to the hearty plaudits of the
English, Colonel Cody ordered the band to play “God Save
the Queen,” and the Wild West was at home in London.</p>

<p>The first camp meal being necessarily eaten in full view of
the crowd, the dining-tents not being ready, was a novel sight
to them, from the motley population of Indians, cowboys,
scouts, Mexicans, etc. The meal was finished by 7 o’clock,
and by 9 o’clock the little camp was complete, and its tired
occupants, men, women, and children, were reposing more
snugly, safely, and peacefully than they had done in many
weeks.</p>

<p>Trivial as these details may appear at first sight, the rapidity
with which the Wild West had transported its materials from
dock to depot, and depot to ground, had an immense effect
upon the people of London. A number of notable visitors
present, especially the representatives of the press, expressed
great astonishment at the enterprise of the Americans, and
communicated that feeling throughout London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
“The Yankees mean business” was the expression heard
upon all sides. As the Wild West was not to open its exhibition
for several days after its arrival, Colonel Cody and Mr.
Salsbury had an opportunity of meeting many distinguished
persons in England, who called upon them, and who afterward
proved most friendly and hospitable. Among these prominent
persons was Mr. Henry Irving, who had witnessed the
Wild West performance at Staten Island, and paved the way
in a great measure for its success in London by speaking in
the kindest terms to a representative of the great dramatic
organ, <i>The Era</i>. It may not be amiss to here quote his
remarks. Mr. Irving said in <i>The Era</i>:</p>

<p>“I saw an entertainment in New York, the like of which I
had never seen before, which impressed me immensely. It is
coming to London. It is an entertainment in which the whole
of the most interesting episodes of life on the extreme frontier
of civilization in America are represented with the most
graphic vividness and scrupulous detail. You have real cowboys
with bucking horses, real buffaloes, and great hordes of
steers, which are lassoed and stampeded in the most realistic
fashion imaginable. Then there are real Indians, who execute
attacks upon coaches driven at full speed. No one can
exaggerate the extreme excitement and ‘go’ of the whole
performance. It is simply immense, and I venture to predict
that when it comes to London it will take the town by storm.”</p>

<p>Among other early callers upon the Wild West, and who
gave their influence and friendly aid in London, were genial
John L. Toole, Miss Ellen Terry, Mr. Justin McCarthy,
United States Minister Phelps, Consul-General Gov. Thomas
Waller, Deputy Consul Moffat, Mr. Henry Labouchere, M.&nbsp;P.,
Miss Mary Anderson, Mrs. Brown-Potter, Mr. Charles Wyndham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Lord Ronald Gower, Sir Cundiffe Owen, Lord Henry
Paget, Lord Charles Beresford, the Grand Duke Michael of
Russia, Lady Monckton, Sir Francis Knollys, private secretary
to the Prince of Wales; Colonel Clarke, Colonel Montague,
Lady Alice Beckie (whom the Indians afterward named
the “Sunshine of the Camp”), Lord Strathmore, Lord Windsor,
Lady Randolph Churchill, Mrs. John W. Mackay, and a
host of distinguished American residents in London, who also
visited the camp before the regular opening of the Wild West,
and by their expressions of friendship gave encouragement
for success in the future.</p>

<p>The sight of the Indians, cowboys, American girls, and
Mexicans, with Buffalo Bill as chief, was most attractive to
Londoners, while the English love of horsemanship, feats of
skill, and fondness for sports presaged an appreciative community.
The press was also most generous, the columns of
the papers teeming daily with information so eulogistic that
the Wild Westerners were afraid they would never be able to
come up to expectations.</p>

<p>Fifty large scrap-books, filled to repletion with press
notices, now form a conspicuous part of Colonel Cody’s
library at Scout’s-Rest Ranch. The London <i>Illustrated News</i>,
in connection with two pages of illustration, is drawn upon
for the following extract:</p>

<p>“It is certainly a novel idea for one nation to give an
exhibition devoted exclusively to its own frontier history, or
the story enacted by genuine characters of the dangers and
hardships of its settlement, upon the soil of another country
3,000 miles away. Yet this is exactly what the Americans
will do this year in London, and it is an idea worthy of that
thorough-going and enterprising people. We frankly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
gladly allow that there is a natural and sentimental view of
the design which will go far to obtain for it a hearty welcome
in England. The progress of the United States, now the
largest community of the English race on the face of the
earth, though not in political union with Great Britain, yet
intimately connected with us by social sympathies; by a
common language and literature; by ancestral traditions and
many centuries of common history; by much remaining
similarity of civil institutions, laws, morals, and manners; by
the same forms of religions; by the same attachments to the
principles of order and freedom, and by the mutual interchange
of benefits in a vast commerce, and in the materials
and sustenance of their staple industries, is a proper subject
of congratulation; for the popular mind in the United Kingdom
does not regard, and will never be taught to regard,
what are styled ‘imperial’ interests&mdash;those of mere political
dominion&mdash;as equally valuable with the habits and ideas and
domestic life of the aggregate of human families belonging
to our own race. The greater numerical proportion of these,
already exceeding sixty millions, are inhabitants of the great
American Republic, while the English-speaking subjects of
Queen Victoria number a little above forty-five millions,
including those in Canada and Australasia and scattered
among the colonial dependencies of this realm. It would be
unnatural to deny ourselves the indulgence of a just gratification
in seeing what men of our own blood, men of our own
mind and disposition in all essential respects, though
tempered and sharpened by more stimulating conditions,
with some wider opportunities for exertion, have achieved in
raising a wonderful fabric of modern civilization, and bringing
it to the highest prosperity, across the whole breadth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Western Continent, from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.
We feel sure that this sentiment will prevail in the hearts of
hundreds of thousands of visitors to Buffalo Bill’s American
camp, about to be opened at the west end of London; and
we take it kindly of the great kindred people of the United
States that they now send such a magnificent representation
to the motherland, determined to take some part in celebrating
the jubilee of her majesty the queen, who is the
political representative of the people of Great Britain and
Ireland.”</p>

<p>The tone of this article strikes the same chord as the
whole of the comments of the English press. It divested
the Wild West of its attributes as an entertainment simply,
and treated the visit as an event of first-class international
importance, and a link between the affections of the two
kindred nations such as had never before been forged.</p>

<span class="subhead">A ROYAL WELCOME.</span></h2>

<p>While in the midst of extensive preparations for their
opening, the proprietors of the Wild West received an intimation
that the ex-premier, the Rt. Hon. W.&nbsp;E. Gladstone,
M.&nbsp;P., proposed honoring them with a preliminary
call. The date fixed for the visit was the 25th of April, and
shortly after 1 o’clock <span class="smcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> on that day the distinguished
visitor arrived at Earl’s Court with Mrs. Gladstone, and
accompanied by the Marquis of Lorne (husband of the
Princess Louise), attended by Lord Ronald Gower and Mr.
Waller (Consul-General of the United States), escorted by
Nate Salsbury.</p>

<p>The cowboy band welcomed the visitors with the strains
of “Yankee Doodle,” and they were presently introduced to
Colonel Cody, who in turn presented to them the denizens
of the encampment. The Grand Old Man was soon
engaged in conversation with Red Shirt, to whom Colonel
Cody had explained that Mr. Gladstone was one of the great
white chiefs of England. Red Shirt was much puzzled by
Mr. Gladstone’s inquiring, through an interpreter, if he
thought the Englishman looked enough like the American
for him to believe that they were kinsmen and brothers. Red
Shirt created quite a laugh by replying that “he wasn’t quite
sure about that.” It would be hard to picture the astonishment
of the visitors when the Indians, in full war-paint,
riding their swift horses, dashed into the arena from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
ambuscade, and the enthusiasm grew immense when Colonel
Cody placed himself at the head of the whole body and
wheeled them into line for a general salute. It was a real
treat to see the ex-premier enjoying himself like a veritable
school-boy when the lasso, the feats of shooting, and the
bucking-horses were introduced; and when the American
cowboys tackled the incorrigible bucking-horses he sometimes
cheered the animal and sometimes the man. At the conclusion
of the exhibition Mr. Gladstone expressed himself as
having been greatly entertained and interested, and spoke in
warm and affecting terms of the instrumental good work the
Wild West had come to do. In a brilliant little speech he
proposed “success to the Wild West Show,” which aroused
the enthusiasm of all present. His demeanor on this and
other occasions when he met the Americans made clear to
them the reason of the fascination he exercises over the
masses of his countrymen.</p>

<p>Then for Colonel Cody commenced a long series of invitations
to breakfasts, dinners, luncheons, midnight layouts,
and other attentions by which London society delights to
honor a distinguished foreigner. In addition to many receptions
tendered him, he was made an honorary member of
most of the best clubs, notably the Reform Club, where he
was presented to the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge,
and many prominent gentlemen. He was afterward
a guest at a civic lunch at the Mansion House, with the Lord
Mayor and Lady Mayoress; a dinner at the Beaufort Club,
where that fine sportsman the Duke of Beaufort occupied the
chair; and a memorable evening at the Savage Club, with Mr.
Wilson Barrett (who had just returned from America) presiding,
and an attendance comprising such great spirits as Mr. Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Irving, John L. Toole, and others great in literary, artistic,
and histrionic London. At the United Arts Club he was
entertained by the Duke of Teck, and at the St. George’s
Club by Lord Bruce, Lord Woolmer, Lord Lymington, Mr.
Christopher Sykes, Mr. Herbert Gladstone, and others. Subsequently
he dined at Mr. Irving’s, Lady McGregor’s, Lady
Tenterden’s, Mrs. Charles Matthews’ (widow of the great
actor), Mrs. J.&nbsp;W. Mackay’s, Lord Randolph and Lady
Churchill’s, Edmund Yates’, and at Great Marlow. These are
but a very few of the many invitations he was called upon to
accept during this visit. When Mr. and Mrs. Labouchere
gave their grand garden production of “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream” Colonel Cody was an honored guest. He
also accompanied Lord Charles Beresford in the Coaching
Club Parade in Hyde Park, and was prevented by press of
business from accepting an invitation to a mount with the
Honorable Artillery Company of London (the oldest volunteer
in the kingdom), in the parade in honor of her majesty
the queen’s birthday.</p>

<p>Considering the fact that the Indians were all new from the
Pine Ridge Agency and had never seen the exhibition, and
that 100 of the ponies came direct from the plains of Texas
and had never been ridden or shot over, it is a wonder how
Colonel Cody, with these social demands made upon his time,
succeeded in forming so good an exhibition on the opening day.</p>

<p>During all this fashionable hurly-burly Colonel Cody
received the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2"><span class="smcap">Marlborough House,</span></span><br />
<span class="smcap">Pall Mall, S. W.</span>, April 26, 1887.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: I am desired by the Prince of Wales to
thank you for your invitation. His royal highness is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
anxious I should see you with reference to it. Perhaps,
therefore, you would kindly make it convenient to call at
Marlborough House.</p>

<p>Would it suit you to call at 11.30 or 5 o’clock either
to-morrow (Wednesday) or Thursday? I am, dear sir,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l8">Yours faithfully,</span><br />
<span class="l2">(Signed) <span class="smcap">Francis Knollys</span>,</span><br />
<i>Private Secretary</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This resulted in an arrangement to give a special and
exclusive performance for H.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;H. the Prince and Princess
of Wales, although everything was still incomplete, the track
unfinished, and spoiled by rainy weather and the hauling on
of vast timbers. The ground was in unspeakably bad condition.
The Prince of Wales being busily occupied in arranging
matters for the queen’s jubilee had but limited latitude
in regard to time, so postponement was out of the question.
The royal box was handsomely rigged out with American and
English flags, and the party conducted into the precincts of the
Wild West was a strong one numerically as well as in point of
exalted rank: The Prince and Princess of Wales, with their three
daughters, Princesses Louise, Victoria, and Maud, led the way;
then came the Princess Louise and her husband, the Marquis
of Lorne; the Duke of Cambridge; H.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;H. of Teck and his
son; the Comtesse de Paris; the Crown Prince of Denmark;
followed by Lady Suffield and Miss Knollys, Lady Cole,
Colonel Clarke, Lord Edward Somerset, and other high-placed
attendants on the assembled royalties.</p>

<p>Colonel Cody was introduced by the Prince of Wales to
the princess, and introductions to the other exalted personages
followed, in which Nate Salsbury and the writer were
included. This was one of many meetings between his royal
highness and Colonel Cody, and before leaving London the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
prince presented to the colonel a very handsome diamond
copy of his crest&mdash;the three ostrich feathers mounted in gems
and gold&mdash;as a breastpin.</p>

<p>When the prince gave the signal the Indians, yelling like
fiends, galloped out from their ambuscade and swept round
the inclosure like a whirlwind. The effect was instantaneous
and electric. The prince rose from his seat and leaned
eagerly over the front of the box, and the whole party seemed
thrilled at the spectacle. From that moment everything was
all right; everybody was in capital form and the whole thing
went off grandly. At the finish an amusing incident occurred.
Our lady shots, on being presented, cordially offered to shake
hands with the princess. Be it known that feminine royalty
offers the left hand, back uppermost, which the person presented
is expected to reverently lift with the finger-tips and
to salute with the lips. However, the princess got over the
difficulty by taking their proffered hands and shaking them
heartily.</p>

<p>Then followed an inspection of the Indian camp and a talk
between the prince and Red Shirt. His royal highness
expressed through the interpreter his great delight at what he
had seen, and the princess personally offered him a welcome
to England. “Tell the great chief’s wife,” said Red Shirt
with much dignity, “that it gladdens my heart to hear her
words of welcome.” While the ladies of the suite were
petting John Nelson’s half-breed papoose, the prince visited
Colonel Cody’s tent and while there seemed much interested
in the gold-mounted sword presented to Colonel Cody by the
generals of the United States Army. Despite the muddy
state of the ground, the prince and his party made an inspection
of the stables, where 200 bronco horses and other animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
were quartered. He particularly gratified Colonel Cody by
demanding a full, true, and particular history of Old Charlie&mdash;then
in his twenty-first year&mdash;who had carried his owner
through so much arduous work on the plains and who once
bore him over a flight of 100 miles in nine hours and forty
minutes when chased by hostile Indians.</p>

<p>ROYAL VISITORS TO THE WILD WEST, LONDON.</p></div></div>

<p>At 7 o’clock the royal visit, and our first full performance
in England, terminated by the prince presenting the contents
of his cigarette-case to Red Shirt.</p>

<p>A walk around the principal streets of London at this
time would have shown how, by anticipation, the Wild West
had “caught on” to the popular imagination. The windows
of the London bookseller were full of editions of Fenimore
Cooper’s novels, “The Pathfinder,” “The Deerslayer,” “The
Last of the Mohicans,” “Leather Stocking,” and, in short,
all that series of delightful romances which have placed
the name of the American novelist on the same level with
that of Sir Walter Scott. It was a real revival of trade for
the booksellers, who sold thousands of volumes of Cooper,
where twenty years before they had sold them in dozens,
while Colonel Prentiss Ingraham’s realistic “Border Romances
of Buffalo Bill” had a tremendous sale. There
is no doubt that the visit of the Wild West to England set
the population of the British Islands to reading, thinking,
and talking about their American kinsmen to an extent theretofore
unknown. It taught them to know more of the mighty
nation beyond the Atlantic, and consequently to esteem it
better than at any time within the limits of modern history.</p>

<p>The Wild West having made its début in London, the following
comment of the <i>Times</i> and letters from General
Sherman will be appreciated by the reader:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<h3>AMERICAN WILD WEST EXHIBITION.</h3>

<p>The American exhibition, which has attracted all the town
to West Brompton for the last few months, was brought yesterday
to an appropriate and dignified close. A meeting of
representative Englishmen and Americans was held, under the
presidency of Lord Lorne, in support of the movement for
establishing a Court of Arbitration for the settlement of disputes
between this country and the United States. At first
sight it might seem to be a far cry from the Wild West to an
International Court. Yet the connection is not really very
remote. Exhibitions of American products and scenes from
the wilder phases of American life certainly tend, in some
degree at least, to bring America nearer to England. They
are partly cause and partly effect. They are the effect of
increased and increasing intercourse between the two countries,
and they tend to promote a still more intimate understanding.
Those who went to be amused often stayed to be
instructed. The Wild West was irresistible. Colonel Cody
suddenly found himself the hero of the London season.
Notwithstanding his daily engagements and his punctual fulfillment
of them, he found time to go everywhere, to see
everything, and to be seen by all the world. All London
contributed to his triumph, and now the close of his show is
selected as the occasion for promoting a great international
movement, with Mr. Bright, Lord Granville, Lord Wolseley,
and Lord Lorne for its sponsors. Civilization itself consents
to march onward in the train of “Buffalo Bill.” Colonel
Cody can achieve no greater triumph than this, even if he
some day realizes the design attributed to him of running the
Wild West show within the classic precincts of the Coliseum
at Rome.</p>

<p>This association of the cause of international arbitration
with the fortunes of the American Wild West is not without
its grotesque aspects. But it has a serious import, nevertheless.
After all, the Americans and the English are one stock.
Nothing that is American comes altogether amiss to an Englishman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
We are apt to think that American life is not picturesque.
We have been shown one of its most picturesque
aspects. It is true that Red Shirt would be as unusual a
phenomenon in Broadway as in Cheapside. But the Wild
West, for all that, is racy of the American soil. We can
easily imagine Wall Street for ourselves; we need to be shown
the cowboys of Colorado. Hence it is no paradox to say
that Colonel Cody has done his part in bringing America and
England nearer together.&mdash;<i>Editorial from the London Times</i>,
November 1, 1887.</p></blockquote>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The following letters were received by Buffalo Bill from
Gen. W.&nbsp;T. Sherman soon after the opening of the Wild West
in London.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="l6"><span class="smcap">Fifth Avenue Hotel</span>,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">New York</span>, May 8, 1887.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Cody</span>: I was much pleased to receive your dispatch
of May 5th announcing the opening of the Wild
West in old London, and that your first performance was
graced by the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales.
I had penned a short answer to go by cable, but it fell so far
short of my thoughts that I tore it up and preferred the old-fashioned
letter, which I am sure you can afford to await.
After your departure in the State of Nebraska I was impatient
until the cable announced your safe arrival in the
Thames, without the loss of a man or animal during the
voyage. Since that time our papers have kept us well
“posted,” and I assure you that no one of your host of friends
on this side of the water was more pleased to hear of your
safe arrival and of your first exhibition than myself. I had,
in 1872, the honor and great pleasure of meeting the Prince
of Wales and the Princess Alexandra on board our fleet in
Southampton Bay, and was struck by the manly, frank
character of the prince, and the extreme beauty and grace of
the princess. The simple fact that they honored your opening
exhibition assures us all that the English people will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
construe your party as a show, but a palpable illustration
of the men and qualities which have enabled the United
States to subdue the 2,000 miles of our wild West continent,
and make it the home of civilization. You and I remember
the time when we needed a strong military escort to go from
Fort Riley in Kansas to Fort Kearney on the Platte; when
emigrants to Colorado went armed and organized as soldiers,
where now the old and young, rich and poor, sweep across
the plains in palace cars with as much comfort as on a ride
from London to Edinburgh. Your exhibition better illustrates
the method by which this was accomplished than a
thousand volumes of printed matter. The English people
always have, and I hope always will love pluck and endurance.
You have exhibited both, and in nothing more than
your present venture, and I assure you that you have my best
wishes for success in your undertaking.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Hon. Wm. F. Cody</span>,<br />
<span class="in4">London, England.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Cody</span>: * * * In common with all your countrymen,
I want to let you know that I am not only gratified, but
proud of your management and general behavior; so far as
I can make out, you have been modest, graceful, and dignified
in all you have done to illustrate the history of civilization on
this continent during the past century.</p>

<p>I am especially pleased with the graceful and pretty compliment
paid you by the Princess of Wales, who rode in the
Deadwood coach while it was attacked by the Indians and
rescued by the cowboys. Such things did occur in our days,
and may never again.</p>

<p>As near as I can estimate, there were <i>in 1865 about nine
and a half millions of buffaloes</i> on the plains between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
Missouri River and the Rocky Mountains. All are now gone&mdash;killed
for their meat, their skins and bones.</p>

<p>This seems like desecration, cruelty, and murder, yet they
have been replaced by twice as many <i>neat</i> cattle. At that
date there were about 165,000 <i>Pawnees, Sioux, Cheyennes,
Kiowas, and Arapahoes</i>, who depended on these buffaloes
for their yearly food. They, too, are gone, and have been
replaced by twice or thrice as many white men and women,
who have made the earth to blossom as the rose, and who can
be counted, taxed, and governed by the laws of nature and
civilization. This change has been salutary, and will go on
to the end. You have caught one epoch of the world’s history,
have illustrated it in the very heart of the modern world&mdash;London&mdash;and
I want you to feel that on this side the water
we appreciate it.</p>

<p>This drama must end; days, years, and centuries follow
fast; even the drama of civilization must have an end.</p>

<p>All I aim to accomplish on this sheet of paper is to assure
you that I fully recognize your work and that the presence of
the queen, the beautiful Princess of Wales, the prince, and
British public, are marks of favor which reflect back on
America sparks of light which illuminate many a house and
cabin in the land where once <i>you guided me honestly and faithfully
in 1865&ndash;66 from Fort Riley to Kearney in Kansas and
Nebraska</i>.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<span class="subhead">A VISIT FROM QUEEN VICTORIA.</span></h2>

<p>“By command of her majesty the queen.”&mdash;It must be
understood that the queen never requests, desires, or invites
even her own prime minister, to her own dinner-tables, but
“commands” invariably. A special performance was given
by the Wild West, the understanding being that her majesty
and suite would take a private view of the performance. The
queen, ever since the death of her husband nearly thirty
years ago, has cherished an invincible objection to appearing
before great assemblages of her subjects. She visits her
parliament seldom, the theaters never. Her latest knowledge
of her greatest actors and actresses has been gained from
private performances at Windsor, whither they have been
“commanded” to entertain her, and that at very infrequent
intervals. But, as with Mahomet and the mountain, the Wild
West was altogether too colossal to take to Windsor, and so
the queen came to the Wild West&mdash;an honor which was
unique and unexampled in its character. When this visit was
announced the public would hardly believe it, and if bets had
been made at the clubs, the odds on a rank outsider in the
Derby would have been nothing to the amount that would
have been bet that it was a Yankee hoax. The news that her
majesty would arrive at 5 o’clock and would require to see
everything in an hour was in the nature of an astounding
surprise to the management of the Wild West; but they
determined to do the very best in their power, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
settled it. A dais for her majesty was erected and a box
specially constructed draped with crimson velvet and decorated
with orchids, leaving plenty of accommodation for the
attendant noblemen, and all was made as bright and cheerful
as possible.</p>

<p>With royal punctuality the sovereign lady and her suite
rolled up in their carriages, drove around the arena in state,
and dismounted at the entrance to the box. The august company
included, besides her majesty, their royal highnesses
Prince and Princess of Battenburg, the Marquis of Lorne, the
dowager Duchess of Athole, and the Hon. Ethel Cadogan,
Sir Henry and Lady Ponsonby, Gen. Lynedoch Gardiner,
Col. Sir Henry Ewart, Lord Ronald Gower, and a collection
of uniformed celebrities and brilliantly attired fair ladies, who
formed a veritable parterre of living flowers around the temporary
throne.</p>

<p>During the introduction of the performers of the exhibition
a remarkable incident occurred which is worthy of being
specially recorded. As usual in the entertainment the American
flag, carried by a graceful, well-mounted horseman, was
introduced, with the statement that it was “an emblem of
peace and friendship to all the world.” As the standard-bearer,
who on this occasion was Col. William F. Cody himself,
waved the proud emblem above his head, her majesty
rose from her seat and bowed deeply and impressively toward
the banner. The whole court party rose, the ladies bowed,
the generals present saluted, and the English noblemen took
off their hats. Then there arose from the company such
a genuine, heart-stirring American yell as seemed to shake
the sky. It was a great event. For the first time in history
since the Declaration of Independence a sovereign of Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
Britain had saluted the star-spangled banner&mdash;and that
banner was carried by Buffalo Bill. It was an outward and
visible sign of the extinction of that mutual prejudice, sometimes
almost amounting to race hatred, that had severed the
two nations from the times of Washington and George III.
to the present day. The hatchet was buried at last, and the
Wild West had been at the funeral.</p>

<p>The queen not only abandoned her original intention of
remaining to see only the first acts, but saw the whole thing
through, and wound up with a “command” that Buffalo Bill
should be presented to her, and her compliments were deliberate
and unmeasured. Mr. Nate Salsbury and Chief Red
Shirt, the latter gorgeous in his war-paint and splendid
feather trappings, were also presented. The chief’s proud
bearing seemed to take with the royal party immensely, and
when he quietly declared that “he had come a long way to
see her majesty, and felt glad,” and strolled abruptly away,
the queen smiled appreciatively, as one who would say, “I
know a real duke when I see him.” After inspecting the
papooses the queen’s visit came to an end, with a last “command,”
expressed through Sir Henry Ponsonby, that a record
of all she had seen should be sent on to Windsor.</p>

<p>While receiving generous attention from the most prominent
English people, Colonel Cody was by no means neglected
by his own countrymen, many of whom were frequent visitors
to the Wild West Show, and added by their presence and influence
much to the popularity of both the show and Colonel
Cody himself. Hon. James G. Blaine, accompanied by his
family, spent several hours in Colonel Cody’s tent, and was a
frequent visitor to the show. So also were Hon. Joseph
Pulitzer, Chauncey M. Depew, Lawrence Jerome, Murat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
Halstead, General Hawley, Simon Cameron, and many other
distinguished Americans.</p>

<p>When the Hon. James G. Blaine visited the Wild West
in London, accompanied by his wife and daughters, his
carriage was driven through the royal gate to the grounds,
and he was received by the English people as though he had
been one of the royal highnesses.</p>

<p>The Wild West band played the “Star Spangled Banner,”
the air so loved by all true Americans being received by the
English audience rising, and standing while Mr. Blaine and
party alighted from their carriage and were escorted to the
box set aside for them.</p>

<p>When the distinguished party were seated the band played
“Way Down in Maine” and “Yankee Doodle.” After the
entertainment, when Mr. Blaine took his departure, he was
given three rousing cheers by the English, a tribute which he
gracefully acknowledged and appreciated fully.</p>

<p>So many prominent Americans, acquaintances of Colonel
Cody, were in London at that time that it was determined to
give them a novel entertainment that would serve the double
purpose of regaling their appetites while affording an illustration
of the wild habits of many Indian tribes. In accordance
with this resolution Gen. Simon Cameron&mdash;as the guest of
honor and about one hundred other Americans, including
those named above, were invited to a rib-roast breakfast prepared
by the Indians after the manner of their cooking when
in their native homes.</p>

<p>The large dining-tent was gorgeously festooned and
decorated for the occasion, and all the invited guests responded
to the summons and arrived by 9 o’clock in the morning.
Before the tent a fire had been made, around which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
were grouped a number of Indian cooks. A hole had been
dug in the ground and in this a great bed of coals was now
made, over which was set a wooden tripod from which was
suspended several ribs of beef. An Indian noted for his
skill as a rib-roaster attended to the cooking by gently moving
the meat over the hot coals for nearly half an hour, when
it was removed to the quarters and there jointed ready to be
served. The guests were much interested in the process of
cooking and were equally anxious to sample the product of
Indian culinary art. The whole of the Indian tribes in camp
breakfasted with the visitors, squatting on straw at the end of
the long dining-tent. Some dozen ribs were cooked and
eaten in this primitive fashion, civilized and savage methods
of eating confronting each other. The thoroughly typical
breakfast over, excellent speeches, chiefly of a humorous
nature, were made by the honored guest General Cameron,
Colonel Cody, and others of the party. The breakfast was
supplemented by an Indian dance, and thus ended the unique
entertainment.</p>

<p>On the 20th of June a special morning exhibition of the
Wild West was, by further “command” from her majesty,
given to the kingly and princely guests of Queen Victoria
upon the occasion of her jubilee. This was the third entertainment
given to royalty in private, and surely never before
in the history of the world had such a gathering honored a
public entertainment. The gathering of personages consisted
of the King of Denmark, the King of Saxony, the King and
Queen of the Belgians and the King of Greece, the Crown
Prince of Austria, the Prince and Princess of Saxe-Meiningen,
the Crown Prince and Princess of Germany,
the Crown Prince of Sweden and Norway, the Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Victoria of Prussia, the Duke of Sparta, the Grand
Duke Michael of Russia, Prince George of Greece, Prince
Louis of Baden, and last, but not least, the Prince and Princess
of Wales with their family, besides a great host of lords
and ladies innumerable.</p>

<p>A peculiar circumstance of the visit of Queen Victoria to
the Wild West exhibition may be mentioned here. It was at
the time of the queen’s jubilee, and there had gathered in
London the largest and grandest assemblage of royalty ever
before known in the world’s history, to do honor to the
queen’s reign of half a century.</p>

<p>It was the day before her majesty had appointed to meet
all the royal personages that she came face to face with them,
all gathered together to do honor to the American entertainment
of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West; an honor indeed to the
famous scout, and which was commented upon by the Prince
of Wales, who referred to the great number of distinguished
people present, and that it was made possible by the fact that
peace reigned upon earth with all nations who were there
represented.</p>

<p>On this occasion the good old Deadwood coach, “baptized
in fire and blood” so repeatedly on the plains, had the honor
of carrying on its time-honored timbers four kings and the
Prince of Wales. This elicited from his royal highness the
remark to Colonel Cody, “Colonel, you never held four kings
like these before,” to which Colonel Cody promptly and aptly
replied, “I’ve held four kings, but four kings and the Prince
of Wales makes a royal flush, such as no man ever held
before.” At this the prince laughed heartily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
After this interesting gathering Colonel Cody received
from Marlborough House the following letter of thanks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Marlborough House, Pall Mall, S. W.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: Lieut.-Gen. Sir Dighton Probyn, comptroller
and treasurer of the Prince of Wales’ household, presents his
compliments to Colonel Cody, and is directed by his royal
highness to forward him the accompanying pin as a souvenir
of the performance of the Wild West which Colonel Cody
gave before the Prince and Princess of Wales, the kings of
Denmark, Belgium, Greece, and Saxony, and other royal
guests, on Monday last, to all of whom, the prince desires
Sir Dighton Probyn to say, the entertainment gave great
satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">London</span>, June 22, 1887.</p></blockquote>

<p>This souvenir pin bore the crest and motto of the Prince
of Wales, and readers will perhaps be familiar with the story
of how this crest and motto (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ich dien</i>, “I serve”) were
wrested from the King of Bohemia at Cressy by the Black
Prince, son of Edward III. of England.</p>

<p>Few men have had such honors bestowed upon them as
has Buffalo Bill, for he can also point with pride to a superb
diamond crest presented him by Queen Victoria, the elegant
pin from the Prince of Wales, while from Prince George of
Russia he received a magnificent gold tankard of mosaic
pattern.</p>

<p>Other royal personages have also made him the recipient
of many costly gifts, while persons in private life have shown
their appreciation of the record he has won in many ways.</p>

<p>The prince and princess and their sons and daughters were
frequent visitors to the Wild West during its stay in London.
Upon one occasion his royal highness determined to try the
novel sensation of a ride in the old stage, and notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
some objection on the part of her royal husband, the
princess also booked for inside passage and took it smilingly,
seeming highly delighted with the experience. On one occasion
the royal lady startled the managers of the show by an
intimation that she would that evening attend the performance
<i>incognito</i>. The manager whose duty it was to receive
her declared himself in a “middling tight fix” as to where
and how to seat her. Upon her arrival, in answer to the
question if she desired any particular position, the lady replied,
“Certainly, yes. Put me immediately among the people. I
like the people.” The manager, with great thoughtfulness,
ushered her into one of the press boxes, with Colonel Montague,
Mrs. Clark, and her brother the Prince of Denmark.
Later, to his surprise, several of the newspaper boys came
into the adjoining box, and in order to avert the latter’s suspicion
of who the lady occupant of the box was, the manager was
compelled to address the royal lady and her escort as “Colonel
and Mrs. Jones, friends of mine from Texas.” The princess
took the joke with becoming gravity, and afterward
confessed the evening was one of the pleasantest and funniest
she had ever spent in her life.</p>

<p>And so, amid the innumerable social junketings, roastings,
and courtly functions, added to hard work, the London
experiences of the Wild West drew to a successful close.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE HOME TRAIL.</span></h2>

<p>From London the Wild West visited Birmingham, where it
occupied the Aston Lower Grounds; thence to Manchester&mdash;“Cottonopolis,”
as it is endearingly called by its inhabitants&mdash;where
the winter season was opened. In the short space of
two months the largest theater ever seen in the world was
here erected by an enterprising firm of Manchester builders,
together with a commodious building attached to it for the
accommodation of the troupe, whose tents and tepees were
erected under its shelter. The whole of the structure was comfortably
heated by steam and illuminated by electric light. This
building was built on the great race-course, where several
times in the course of each year it is not uncommon for 80,000
or 100,000 persons to assemble; and the buildings in which
Ormonde, Ben d’Or, Robert the Devil, and a thousand other
world-famed equine wonders had taken their rest and refreshment,
were now appropriated to the comfort of the broncos,
mustangs, and other four-footed coadjutors of the Wild West.</p>

<p>The first performance given in Manchester was complimentary,
and the entire beauty, rank, and fashion of Manchester
and the surrounding towns were invited guests. The
mayors, town councils, corporation officials, prominent
merchants and manufacturers, bishops and clergy of all
denominations, and an able-bodied horde of pressmen came
down in their thousands. From Liverpool, across country
through Leeds and York to Hull and New Castle, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Carlisle, as far south as Birmingham, everybody of consequence
was present, and the immense building was filled to its
utmost capacity. The consequence was that from the opening
day, and despite the dreary winter weather, the well-lighted,
well-warmed “Temple of Buffalo Bill and Thespis”&mdash;as somebody
called it&mdash;was constantly crowded with pleasure-seeking
throngs. Incidentally it may be mentioned that the scores of
requisitions from the heads of schools and charitable institutions
for reduced rates for “their little waifs,” was always
met by the management of the Wild West with a courteous
invitation for the little ones to attend the Wednesday afternoon
performances free of charge. During their stay in “Cottonopolis”
the members of the Wild West were welcomed
with the same ungrudging and overwhelming hospitality that
had marked their visit to the capital. While here Colonel
Cody was publicly presented with a magnificent rifle by the artistic,
dramatic, and literary gentlemen of Manchester, and the
event having got wind in London, the élite of the metropolitan
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">literati</i>, headed by Sir Somers Vine and including representatives
of all the great American journals, secured a special
train and ran up to Manchester some hundred strong to grace
the ceremony with their presence. The presentation took
place in the arena, and afterward Colonel Cody invited the
whole crowd of local celebrities and London visitors to a regular
camp dinner, with fried oysters, Boston pork and beans,
Maryland chicken, and other American dishes, and a real
Indian “rib-roast” as the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">piece de resistance</i>. The banquet
was held in the race-course pavilion. Among the guests were
the Mayor of Salford, a number of civic dignitaries from both
Manchester and the neighboring borough, United States Consul
Moffat of London and Consul Hale of Manchester, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
latter of whom made the speech of the evening. This dinner
was certainly an entirely original lay-out to the visitors, and
the comments of the English guests upon the novel and
to them outlandish fare they were consuming were highly
amusing to the American members of the party. To the
Englishmen corn-cake, hominy, and other American <i>fixings</i>
were a complete revelation, and the rib-roast, served in tin
platters and eaten in the fingers, without knives or forks, was
a source of huge wonderment. The American flag was rarely
ever toasted more heartily by Englishmen than on that
occasion, and for a week afterward the press of the
country were dilating on the strange and savage doings at
the Wild West camp.</p>

<p>The afternoon of Good Friday, the consent of the directors
of the Manchester race-track having been obtained, a
series of open-air horse races and athletic sports was performed
by the members of the company&mdash;red and white&mdash;which
included hurdle-races, bareback horsemanship, etc.
Notwithstanding very inclement weather during the earlier
part of the day, an attendance of nearly 30,000 was recorded,
and the weather cleared up and kept fine during the progress
of the sports.</p>

<p>During this visit to Manchester the Freemasons of the
district treated Colonel Cody with marked hospitality, and he
was a frequent visitor at their lodges. A mark of especial
honor from this occult and powerful body was a public presentation
to him of a magnificent gold watch in the name
of the Freemasons of England. The season in Manchester
was a grand success in every way, and the people had begun
to regard the institution as a permanency among them; but
their engagements in the land of the stars and stripes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
as fixed and unalterable as the laws of the Medes and
Persians, and on Monday evening, May 1st, was given the
last indoor representation in Manchester. The occasion was
a perfect ovation. On Tuesday afternoon a benefit was tendered
Colonel Cody by the race-course people. An outdoor
performance was given, and despite the unfavorable weather
the turn-stiles showed that nearly 50,000 people had paid
admission to the grounds. Thus ended the Wild West performances
in Manchester.</p>

<p>On Friday morning, May 4th, at 11 <span class="smcap smaller">A. M.</span>, amid the
cheers, well-wishes, and handshaking of a vast crowd, the
Wild West left Manchester by special train for Hull, where
the last performance in England was given on the afternoon
of Saturday, May 5th, and at 9 o’clock on that evening
the entire effects of the monster aggregation were aboard the
good ship Persian Monarch, upon which vessel, under the
command of the brave, gallant, and courteous Captain Bristow,
the Wild West left for New York the next morning at 3 o’clock.
On the homeward voyage Colonel Cody’s favorite horse
Charlie died. For fifteen years he had ridden Charlie in sunshine
and in storm, in days of adversity as well as prosperity,
and to this noble animal’s fleetness of foot Colonel Cody owed
his life on more than one occasion when pursued by Indians.</p>

<p>During the night of May 19th, the Persian Monarch
arrived off New York harbor, and by daylight of the 20th
steamed up toward Staten Island, where they were to debark.</p>

<p>The arrival of this vessel, outside of the company’s reception,
was an event of future commercial importance to the port
of New York, from the fact of her being the first passenger-ship
of her size, draught, and class to effect a landing (at
Bechtel’s wharf) directly on the shores of Staten Island, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
demonstrating the marine value of some ten miles of seashore
of what in a few short years must be a part of the greater
New York.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of this giant combination at its home, it
would seem that a long and undisturbed rest would have been
natural and consequent. Such, however, was not to be the
case. The master-mind concluded that it would be well to
show to his own countrymen what manner of exhibition it was
that had accomplished such wonderful results on its visit to
Albion. A summer season was inaugurated at Erastina, S.&nbsp;I.,
and New York followed. In this latter city Colonel Cody
originated, at Madison Square Garden, the now popular and
much-copied idea of leviathan spectacle. Visits respectively
to Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington followed, and this
remarkable exhibition closed, at the Richmond, Va., exposition,
a wonderful and uninterrupted season which had begun
two years and seven months before at St. Louis, Mo. Faithful
to his promises, and following his invariable custom, Colonel
Cody saw that all his people, from the Texan cowboy and
the Mexican vacquero to the Sioux warrior of Dakota, had
safe and pleasant conduct to their homes. The realistic story
of America had been told in the mother country, and the
interest of Continental Europe had also been awakened.
The returning red man, cowboy, and Mexican had had experiences
and learned lessons the value of which it is impossible
to compute, and the influence of which must perforce permeate
their entire lives and broaden their thought and moral
nature, leading to results of unbounded possibilities. The
cowboy by the camp-fire of his prairie home, the vacquero
among his companions in Mexico’s mountains, and the red
man in his lodge and with his people, had wonderful tales to
tell during the winter nights of their well-earned resting-spell.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<span class="subhead">SWINGING AROUND EUROPE.</span></h2>

<p>This man of many parts, this unique exemplification of
the possibilities of human intellectual and physical development
and progress, had now passed through successive, and
with all truth it can be said, successful, gradations from the
illiterate urchin of the rough cabin on the plains to a great
practical educator; and the lessons taught in his magnificently
illustrated lectures had for their object the welding together
of human interests and the enlarging of the mutual sympathies
of nations. I am aware that the selfish, captious, and narrow-minded
may see in the exhibitions and travels of the
Wild West under Colonel Cody’s leadership simply a scheme
for personal aggrandizement or for the accumulation of great
wealth. With the same foundation for truth, might not these
same unworthy motives be attributed to the magnetic Edison,
whose discoveries and inventions have startled the world into
a wondering recognition of electric power? to Stanley,
through whose terrible trials, weary wanderings, and persevering
persistency the heart of Africa has been laid bare to
scientific and humane investigation? to Humboldt and scores
of other world-instructors? Such unworthy commentators, to
whose eyes all advancement in knowledge is veneered
with a base coating of selfish aims, are unworthy of serious
consideration.</p>

<p>In pursuance of a resolve made during his visit to England
in 1887, Colonel Cody, in the spring preceding the Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Exposition, set all of his able lieutenants and coadjutors to
work preparing another Wild West for a trip to the French
capital, thence through Continental Europe, and, after another
visit to Old England, back to dear America. Under the spell
of their leader’s energetic and systematic direction, these
trusted assistants soon had all things in complete readiness,
and once again on board the majestic Persian Monarch,
and under the care of that able seaman and popular officer
Captain Bristow, the Wild West was launched upon “the
briny,” for Paris bound.</p>

<p>The Wild West camp in Paris was pitched on immense
grounds near the Porte Maillot, and the welcome extended to
the Americans by the people of the sister republic was hearty,
spontaneous, and grand. It was said that the audience which
assembled on the occasion of the opening exhibition equaled
any known in the record of <i>premières</i> of that brilliant <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">capitale
des deux mondes</i>. Early in the performance the vast audience
became thoroughly enthusiastic, and every act attracted
the closest attention and the most absorbing interest. It was
evident that the novel and startling display had won the fullest
approval of the experienced sight-seers of the gay capital;
and in France audiences rarely if ever take the middle ground.
With them approval or commendation comes promptly and is
quickly manifested, and the immediate triumph of the Wild
West was a subject of hearty congratulation. As in England
upon his first appearance there Colonel Cody was welcomed
by those highest in authority and honor, so in France the
initial performance was graced by the presence of the notables
of the republic. President Carnot and wife, the members
of his cabinet, and families; two American ministers, Hon.
Whitelaw Reid, Hon. Louis MacLean; the Diplomatic Corps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
officers of the United States Marine, and other prominent
personages were among the auditors. It was an audience
thoroughly representative of science, art, literature, and
society, and the Wild West soon became second only in public
interest to the great Exhibition itself. Colonel Cody soon
became the recipient of especial social courtesies, the first of
which was a breakfast given in his honor on May 29th by the
Vicomtesse Chaudon de Briailles, at which the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">haut ton</i> of Paris
was present. In recognition of the courtesy of the Minister
of War in granting the Wild West the use of a large tract of
land in the military district, Colonel Cody invited fifty
soldiers of the garrison of Paris to visit the show each day, a
courtesy that was duly appreciated.</p>

<p>Among the many incidents that occurred in Paris may be
noted the fact that Isabella, ex-Queen of Spain, with her companions
enjoyed a ride in the famous old Deadwood stagecoach.</p>

<p>Altogether the Wild West’s visit to Paris, which lasted
seven months, was a most thorough and emphatic success,
and closed in a blaze of glory.</p>

<p>It may seem strange to claim that the Wild West abroad
was an incentive to the introduction of American subjects for
art illustration; but the facts strongly warrant the assertion.</p>

<p>It became a fad to introduce curios and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bijouterie</i> from the
American plains and mountains. Buffalo robes of Indian tanning,
bear-skins embroidered with porcupine quills, and mats
woven in redskin camps became fashionable; while lassos,
bows and arrows, Mexican bridles and saddles, and other
things from the American borderland became most popular
as souvenirs.</p>

  <img src="images/i_235.jpg" width="364" height="615" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">ROSA BONHEUR’S PAINTING, “BUFFALO BILL ON HORSEBACK.”</div></div>

<p>Nor was this all, for the artists took a turn at producing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
American scenes, characters, and animals, and the Indian and
cowboy were chiseled in marble. Busts were made of Buffalo
Bill, the illustrated papers were full of pictures of the
Wild West and its characters, and the comic papers were constantly
caricaturing Cody and his people, some of their work
being remarkably clever and artistic in execution.</p>

<p>Invited to the studios of artists in Rome, Berlin, Paris, and
elsewhere, Buffalo Bill extended the courtesies of his camp to
many whose names are known the world over by their works.
The Wild West became a central place of attraction to artists
as well as to military men and statesmen, and often painters
and sculptors were seen going about the camp looking for
subjects for their brush and chisel.</p>

<p>Having accepted an invitation from Rosa Bonheur to visit
her at her elegant chateau, Buffalo Bill in turn extended the
hospitalities of his camp to the famous artist, who day after
day visited it and made studies for her pleasure, giving much
time to sittings for a painting of Colonel Cody.</p>

<p>The result was the superb painting that attracted so much
comment abroad, and which she presented to the great frontiersman,
who prizes it above all the souvenirs he has in his
charming home at North Platte, where it holds the place of
honor.</p>

<p>The painting represents Buffalo Bill mounted upon his
favorite horse, and it is needless to say that where both man
and animal are portraits, it is a work of art coming from such
a hand as that of Rosa Bonheur. The fact of uniting man
and beast in a painting, giving each equal prominence, was
never before done, I believe, by this great artist, yet her hand
did not lose its cunning in departing from the rule of her
life, as all can testify who have seen this superb picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
With America as a vast and grand field for the brushes of
English and European artists, there is little doubt that hereafter
the foreign academies will possess many works on
American scenes and characters; and with the example thus
set them our own artists will find in their own country material
enough to prevent their going to other lands to get artistic
inspiration.</p>

<p>After a short tour in the south of France in the fall, a
vessel was chartered at Marseilles, the Mediterranean crossed
at Barcelona, landing the first band of Americans with accompanying
associates, scouts, cowboys, Mexican horses of
Spanish descent, and wild buffaloes, etc., on the very spot
where on his return to Spain landed the world’s greatest
explorer Christopher Columbus. Here the patrons were
demonstratively eulogistic, the exhibition seeming to delight
them greatly, savoring as it did of an addenda to their national
history; recalling after a lapse of 400 years the resplendent
glories of Spanish conquests under Ferdinand and Isabella, of
the sainted hero Cristobal Colon (1492), Columbus in America
(1890), “Buffalo Bill” and the native American in Spain!</p>

<p>Recrossing the Mediterranean via Corsica and Sardinia
(encountering a tremendous storm), Naples (the placid waters
of whose noble bay gave a welcome refuge) was reached,
and in the shadow of old Vesuvius, which in fact formed a
superbly grand scenic background, another peg in history was
pinned by the visit of the cowboy and Indian to the various
noted localities that here abound; the ruins of Herculaneum,
Pompeii, and the great crater of “the burning mountain”
striking wonder and awe as well as giving geological and
geographical knowledge to the stoical “red man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
Then the “famed of the famous cities” of the world,
Rome, was next visited, to be conquered through the gentle
power of intellectual interest in, and the reciprocal pleasure
exchanged by, its unusual visitors; the honor being given to
“the outfit,” as an organization, of attending a dazzling fête
given in the Vatican by his holiness Pope Leo XIII., and of
receiving the exalted pontiff’s blessing. The grandeur of the
spectacle, the heavenly music, the entrancing singing, and
impressive adjuncts produced a most profound impression on
the astonished children of the prairie. The Wild West in the
Vatican!</p>

<p>The company were photographed in the Coliseum, which
stately ruin seemed silently and solemnly to regret that its
famed ancient arena was too small for this modern exhibition
of the mimic struggle between that civilization born
and emanating from ’neath its very walls, and a primitive
people who were ne’er dreamed of in Rome’s world-conquering
creators’ wildest flights of vivid imaginings.</p>

<p>Strolling through its arena, gazing at its lions’ dens, or
lolling lazily on its convenient ruins, hearing its interpreted
history of Romulus, of Cæsar, and of Nero, roamed this band
of Wild West Sioux (a people whose history in barbaric deeds
equals, if not excels, the ancient Romans’), now hand-in-hand
in peace and firmly cemented friendship with the American
frontiersman, once gladiatorial antagonists on the Western
plains. They, listening to the tale, on the spot, of those whose
“morituri te salutant” was the short prelude to a savage
death, formed a novel picture in a historic frame. The Wild

<p>The following extracts from cablegrams sent to the New

occurrences that happened during the visit of the Wild West
to the historic city of Rome:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Rome</span>, March 4, 1890.
</p>

<p>All Rome was to-day astir over an attempt of Buffalo Bill’s
cowboys with wild horses, which were provided for the occasion
by the Prince of Sermoneta.</p>

<p>Several days past the Roman authorities have been busy
with the erection of specially cut barriers for the purpose of
keeping back the wild horses from the crowds.</p>

<p>The animals are from the celebrated stud of the Prince of
Sermoneta, and the prince himself declared that no cowboy in
the world could ride these horses. The cowboys laughed over
this surmise and then offered at least to undertake to mount
one of them, if they might choose it.</p>

<p>Every man, woman, and child expected that two or three
people would be killed by this attempt.</p>

<p>The anxiety and enthusiasm was great. Over 2,000 carriages
were ranged round the field and more than 20,000
people lined the spacious barriers. Lord Dufferin and many
other diplomatists were on the terrace, and among Romans
were presently seen the consort of the Prime Minister Crispi,
the Prince of Torlonia, Madame Depretis, Princess Collona,
Gravina Antonelli, the Baroness Reugis, Princess Brancaccia,
Grave Giannotti, and critics from among the highest aristocracy.</p>

<p>In five minutes the horses were tamed.</p>

<p>Two of the wild horses were driven without saddle or
bridle in the arena. Buffalo Bill gave out that they would be
tamed. The brutes made springs into the air, darted hither
and thither in all directions, and bent themselves into all sorts
of shapes&mdash;but all in vain.</p>

<p>In five minutes the cowboys had caught the wild horses
with the lasso, saddled, subdued, and bestrode them. Then
the cowboys rode them round the arena, while the dense
crowds of people applauded with delight.</p></blockquote>

<h3>BUFFALO BILL IN VENICE.</h3>

<p>(By Telegraph, New York Herald.)</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Venice</span>, April 16, 1890.
</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill and his Wild West have made a big show in
Venice. This evening the directors have a special invitation
on the Grand Canal, where the whole troupe will be shown.
Colonel Cody is taken by the Venetian prefect in his own
private residence. No one can think them ordinary artistes
after they have seen the gathering of different Indians in
gondolas, or seen the wonderful sight which presents itself at
the Venetian palace and in the little steamboats that ply
between the pier of St. Mark and the railway station.</p>

<p>Thousands of Venetians assembled yesterday in Verona,
where the company of the municipal authorities of justice
have allowed the use of the amphitheater, or the so-called
arena, one of the most interesting structures of Italy, and
a rival of the Coliseum of Rome itself.</p>

<p>Forty-five thousand persons can conveniently find sitting-room
in this arena, and for standing-room there is also
extensive space. As his royal highness Victor Emanuel was
on a visit here once, 60,000 people were accommodated in it.
It is, perhaps, interesting to know that this building is the
largest in the world, although the Wild West Show quite
filled it.</p>

<p>The amphitheater (arena) was built in the year 290 A.&nbsp;D.,
under Diocletian, and is known in Germany as the Home of
the Dietrich of Bern. It is 106 feet high, 168 meters long,
and 134 meters broad (the arena itself is 83 meters long, 48
meters broad); the circumference is 525 meters. In the surrounding
amphitheater (entering by the west side through
arch No. 5, admission 1 franc, Sunday free), are five-and-forty
rows of steps 18 inches high, 26 inches broad, built of
gray, or rather reddish-yellow, limestone, where nearly 20,000
spectators can find places, and where many more people can
see by standing on the wooden benches behind them. From an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
inscription on the second story it will be remembered that
Napoleon I. visited this place in 1805. The restoration of
the building was by recommendation of that emperor. A
wonderful view is obtained from the higher steps.</p></blockquote>

<h3>THE WILD WEST AT THE VATICAN.&mdash;BUFFALO BILL’S INDIANS
AND COWBOYS AT THE ANNIVERSARY CEREMONY OF LEO
XIII.</h3>

<p>New York Herald, March 4, 1890.&mdash;(From our Special
Correspondent.)</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Rome</span>, March 3d.
</p>

<p>One of the strangest spectacles ever seen within the walls
of the Vatican was the dramatic entry of Buffalo Bill at the
head of his Indians and cowboys this morning, when the
ecclesiastical and secular military court of the Holy See
assembled to witness the twelfth annual thanksgiving of Leo
XIII. for his coronation. In the midst of the splendid scene,
crowded with the old Roman aristocracy and surrounded by
walls immortalized by Michael Angelo and Raphael, there
suddenly appeared a host of savages in war-paint, feathers,
and blankets, carrying tomahawks and knives.</p>

<p>A vast multitude surged in the great square before St.
Peter’s early in the morning to witness the arrival of the
Americans. Before half-past 9 o’clock the Ducal Hall, Royal
Hall, and Sistine Chapel of the Vatican were packed with those
who had influence enough to obtain admittance. Through
the middle of the three audiences the pathway was bordered
with the brilliant uniforms of the Swiss Guards, Palatine
Guards, papal gendarmes, and private chamberlains. The
sunlight fell upon the lines of glittering steel, nodding plumes,
golden chains, shimmering robes of silk, and all the blazing
emblems of pontifical power and glory.</p>

<h4>THE WILD WEST MAKE THEIR ENTRÉE.</h4>

<p>Suddenly a tall and chivalrous figure appeared at the
entrance, and all eyes were turned toward him. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
Col. W.&nbsp;F. Cody, “Buffalo Bill.” With a sweep of his
great sombrero he saluted the chamberlains, and then strode
between the guards with his partner, Mr. Nate Salsbury, by
his side.</p>

<p>Rocky Bear led the Sioux warriors, who brought up
the rear. They were painted in every color that Indian
imagination could devise. Every man carried something
with which to make big medicine in the presence of the
great medicine man sent by the great spirit.</p>

<p>Rocky Bear rolled his eyes and folded his hands on
his breast as he stepped on tiptoe through the glowing sea
of color. His braves furtively eyed the halbreds and two-handed
swords of the Swiss Guards.</p>

<p>The Indians and cowboys were ranged in the south corners
of the Ducal Hall. Colonel Cody and Mr. Salsbury were
escorted into the Sistine Chapel by chamberlains, where they
were greeted by Miss Sherman, daughter of General Sherman.
A princess invited Colonel Cody to a place in the tribune of
the Roman nobles.</p>

<p>He stood facing the gorgeous Diplomatic Corps, surrounded
by the Prince and Princess Borghesi, the Marquis Serlupi,
Princess Bandini, Duchess di Grazioli, Prince and Princess
Massimo, Prince and Princess Ruspoli, and all the ancient
noble families of the city.</p>

<h4>THE PAPAL BLESSING.</h4>

<p>When the Pope appeared in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sedia gestatoria</i>, carried
above the heads of his guards, preceded by the Knights of
Malta and a procession of cardinals and archbishops, the cowboys
bowed, and so did the Indians. Rocky Bear knelt
and made the sign of the cross. The pontiff leaned affectionately
toward the rude groups and blessed them. He
seemed to be touched by the sight.</p>

<p>As the papal train swept on the Indians became excited,
and a squaw fainted. They had been warned not to utter a
sound, and were with difficulty restrained from whooping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
The Pope looked at Colonel Cody intently as he passed, and
the great scout and Indian fighter bent low as he received the
pontifical benediction.</p>

<p>After the thanksgiving mass, with its grand choral accompaniment
and now and then the sound of Leo XIII.’s voice
heard ringing through the chapel, the great audience poured
out of the Vatican.</p></blockquote>

<p>Artistic Florence, practical Bologna, grand and stately
Milan, and unique Verona were next added to the list. Verona’s
superb and well-preserved Arena, excelling in
superficial area the Coliseum and holding 45,000 people, was
especially granted for the Wild West’s use. The Indians were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
taken by Buffalo Bill to picturesque Venice, and there shown
the marvelous results of the ancient white man’s energy and
artistic architectural skill. They were immortalized by the
camera in the ducal palace, St. Marc’s Piazza, and in the
strange street vehicle of the Adriatic’s erstwhile pride&mdash;the
gondola; contributing another interesting object lesson to
the distant juvenile student members of their tribe, to testify
more fully to their puzzled senses the fact of strange sights
and marvels whose existence is to be learned in the breadth
of knowledge.</p>

<p>Moving via Innsbruck through the beautifully scenic
Tyrol, the Bavarian capital, Munich, with its naturally artistic
instincts, gave a grand reception to the beginning of a marvelously
successful tour through German land, which included
Vienna (with an excursion on the “Blue Danube”), Berlin,
Dresden, Leipsic, Magdeburg, Hanover, Brunswick, Hamburg,
Bremen, Dusseldorf, Cologne, along the Rhine past Bonn,
Coblentz, “Fair Bingen on the Rhine,” to Frankfort, Stuttgart,
and Strasburg. These historic cities, with all their
wealth of legendary interest, art galleries, scientific conservatories,
educative edifices, cathedrals, modern palaces, ancient
ruins, army maneuverings, fortifications, commercial and
varied manufacturing and agricultural industries, and the
social, genial, friendly, quiet customs of its peoples, should
form good instruction to the rugged rovers of the American
plains&mdash;heirs to an empire as much more vast in extent and
resources as is the brightness of the diamond&mdash;after the skill
expended by the lapidary&mdash;in dazzling brilliancy to the rude,
unpolished stone before man’s <i>industry</i> lends value to its
existence.</p>

<p>At Strasburg the management decided to close temporarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
this extraordinary tour and winter the company. Although
in the proximity of points contemplated for a winter campaign
(southern France and the Riviera), this was deemed advisable
on account of the first and only attack from envious
humanity that the organization had encountered. This matter
necessitated the manly but expensive voluntary procedure of
taking the Indians to America to meet face to face and deny
the imputations of some villifiers, whom circumstances of
petty political “charity” and “I-am-ism” and native buoyancy
permit at times to float temporarily on the surface of a cosmopolite
community, and to whose ravings a too credulous
public and press give hearing.</p>

<p>The quaint little village of Benfield furnished an ancient
nunnery and a castle with stables and good range. Here the
little community of Americans spent the winter comfortably,
being feasted and fêted by the inhabitants, whose esteem they
gained to such an extent that their departure was marked by
a general holiday, assisting hands, and such public demonstrations
of regret that many a rude cowboy when once again
careering o’er the pampas of Texas will rest his weary steed
while memory reverts to the pleasant days and whole-souled
friendships cemented at the foot of the Vosges Mountains in
disputed Alsace-Lorraine.</p>

<p>In Alsace-Lorraine! whose anomalous position menaces
the peace not only of the two countries interested but of the
civilized world; whose situation makes it intensely even
sadly interesting as the theater of that future human tragedy
for which the ear of mankind strains day and night, listening
for detonations from the muzzles of the acme of invented
mechanisms of destruction. The lurid-garbed Angel of
Devastation hovers, careering through the atmosphere of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
seemingly doomed valley, gaily laughing, shrieking exultingly,
at the white-robed Angel of Peace as the latter gloomily
wanders, prayerful, tearful, hopelessly hunting, ceaselessly
seeking, the return of modern man’s boasted newly created
gods&mdash;Equity, Justice, Reason!</p>

<p>What a field for the vaunted champions of humanity, the
leaders of civilization! What a neighborhood wherein to sow
the seeds of “peace on earth and good-will to men.” What a
crucible for the universal panacea, arbitration! What a test
of the efficacy of prayer in damming up the conflicting torrents
of ambition, cupidity, passion, and revenge, which threaten
to color crimson the swift current of the Rhine, until its
renown as the home of wealth and luxury be eclipsed by
eternal notoriety as the Valley of Death!</p>

<p>Leaving the temporary colony under the charge of his
director-partner Mr. Nate Salsbury (whose energy found
occupation in attending to the details of the future), Colonel
Cody and the Indians departed for America, arriving safely,
and after refuting satisfactorily, by the Indians themselves,
the base slanders that emanated in the imagination of notoriety-seeking
busy-bodies, proceeded to the seat of the Indian
difficulties in the distant State of Dakota.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
In this campaign against the Indians Buffalo Bill rendered
valuable services and was ordered to the command of General
Colby of the National Guard of the State of Nebraska, and
to report to General Miles, the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>His authority for going to the front is shown by the
accompanying appointment and order from the governor.</p>

<p>Had the Indian uprising broken out into a general war,
Buffalo Bill would have had the opportunity to show the
world what he could do as a general officer, handling a number
of men in action; but fortunately the splendidly conceived
and executed maneuvers of General Miles, the commander-in-chief,
prevented the outbreak from extending to
all the tribes, and put down the rebellious savages with little
bloodshed, thus saving a long and cruel war upon the
frontier.</p>

<p>The letter given herewith from General Miles, at the conclusion
of the campaign, shows the appreciation by General
Miles of Buffalo Bill’s services, and which met the general
approbation of the press of the country, many correspondents
being upon the field; while Colonel Cody’s telegrams to
the New York <i>Herald</i> and <i>Sun</i> give a most thorough explanation
of the situation.</p>

<h3>AS BUFFALO BILL SEES IT.&mdash;HE THINKS IT LOOKS LIKE PEACE
IN THE INDIAN COUNTRY.</h3>

<p>Buffalo Bill telegraphs to the New York <i>Herald</i> from Pine
Ridge Agency:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2"><span class="smcap">Pine Ridge Agency, Dak.</span>,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">In the Field</span>, via courier to telegraph.
</p>

<p>New York <i>Herald</i>: Your request for my opinion of the
Indian situation is, by reason of the complications and the
changeable nature of the red man’s mind and action, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
puzzler. Every hour brings out a new opinion. Indian
history furnishes no similar situation.</p>

<p>You must imagine about five thousand Indians, an unusual
proportion warriors, better armed than ever known before,
hemmed in by a cordon, about sixteen miles in diameter, composed
of over three thousand troops, acting like a slowly
closing drag-net. This mass of Indians is now influenced by
a percentage as despairingly desperate and fanatical as the
late Big Foot party under Short Bull and Kicking Bear.
It contains also restrained neutrals, frightened and disaffected
Ogalallas, hampered by the powerful Brules, backed by
renegades and desperadoes from all other agencies. There
are about twenty-five hundred acting and believed to be
friendly Indians in and around the agency.</p>

<p>Such is the situation General Miles and the military confront.
Any one of this undisciplined mass is able to precipitate
a terrible conflict from the most unexpected quarter.
Each of the component quantities is to be watched, to be
measured, to be just to. In fact it is a war with a most wily
and savage people, yet the whites are restrained by a humane
and peaceful desire to prevent bloodshed and save a people
from themselves. It is like cooling and calming a volcano.
Ordinary warfare shows no parallel. General Miles seems to
hold a firm grip on the situation. The Indians know him,
express confidence in his honor, truth, and justice to them,
and they fear his power and valor as well.</p>

<p>As the mailer now stands, he and they should be allowed,
untrammeled even by a suggestion, to settle the affair, as no
one not on the spot can appreciate the fearfully delicate position.
The chaff must be sifted from the wheat, and in this
instance the chaff must be threshed.</p>

<p>At the moment, as far as words go, I would say it will be
peace, but the smoldering spark is visible that may precipitate
a terrible conflict any time in the next few days. However
it ends, more and prompt attention should be paid in the
future to the Sioux Indian&mdash;his rights, his complaints, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
his necessities. Respect and consideration should also be
shown for the gallant little army, for it is the Indian and
soldier who pay the most costly price in the end. I think it
looks like peace, and if so the greater the victory.</p>

<h3>THE SITUATION IN THE INDIAN COUNTRY A MARVEL OF MILITARY STRATEGY.</h3>

<p>Col. W. F. Cody (“Buffalo Bill”), who is at Pine Ridge,
telegraphs the following for the New York <i>Sun</i>, which
expresses his views of the present critical situation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The situation to-day, so far as military strategy goes, is
one of the best-marked triumphs known in the history of
Indian campaigns. It speaks for itself, for the usual incidents
to an Indian warfare, such as raids on settlers and
widespread devastation, have been wholly prevented. Only
one white man has been killed outside the military circle. The
presiding genius and his able aids have acted with all the
cautious prowess of the hunter in surrounding and placing in
a trap his dangerous game, at the same time recognizing the
value of keeping the game imprisoned for future reasons. I
speak, of course, of the campaign as originally intended to
overawe and pacify the disaffected portion of the Ogalallas,
Wassaohas, and Brules, the Big Foot affair at Wounded Knee
Creek being an unlooked-for accident.</p>

<p>The situation to-day, with a desperate band corralled and
the possibility of any individual fanatic running amuck, is
most critical, but the wise measure of holding them in a
military wall, allowing them time to quiet down and listen to
the assurances of such men as Young-Man-Afraid-of-His-Horses,
Rocky Bear, No Neck, and other progressive Indians,
relieves the situation, so that unless some accident happens
the military end of the active warfare seems a complete,
final, and brilliant success, as creditable to General Miles’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
military reputation as it is to the humane and just side of his
character.</p>

<p>Neither should praise be withheld from Generals Brooke,
Carr, Wheaton, Henry, Forsythe, and the other officers and
men of the gallant little army, who stood much privation.
In every instance when I have heard them speak they have
expressed great sympathy for their unhappy foe and regrets
for his impoverished and desperate condition. They and
the thoughtful people here are now thinking about the future.
In fact the Government and nation are confronted by a
problem of great importance as regards remedying the existing
evils.</p>

<p>The larger portion of the Ogalalla Sioux have acted
nobly in this affair, especially up to the time of the stampede.
The Wassaohas and Brules have laid waste the reservation of
the Ogalallas, killed their cattle, shot their horses, pillaged
their houses, burned their ranches; in fact, poor as the
Ogalallas were before, the Brules have left nothing but the
bare ground, a white sheet instead of a blanket, with a winter
at hand, and the little accumulations of thirteen years swept
away. This much, as well as race and tribal dissensions and
personal enmity, have they incurred for standing by the
Government. These people need as much sympathy and
immediate assistance as any section of country when great
calamities arouse the sympathy of the philanthropist and the
Government. This is now the part of the situation that to me
seems the most remarkable. Intelligent and quick legislation
can now do more than the bullet.</p>

<span class="subhead">BACK TO EUROPE.</span></h2>

<p>After peace was restored Buffalo Bill secured Government
authority and selected a band of Indians&mdash;composed
equally of the “active friendly,” headed by Chiefs Long
Wolf, No Neck, Yankton Charley, Black Heart, and the
“band of hostages” held by the military under Gen. Nelson
A. Miles at Fort Sheridan, and headed by the redoubtable
Short Bull, Kicking Bear, Lone Bull, Scatter, and Revenge&mdash;for
a short European tour, and they left Philadelphia in the
chartered Red Star steamer Switzerland. The significance
of this fact should <i>still</i> forever the tongue of those who,
without rhyme, truth, or reason, have tried to stain a fair
record, which has been justly earned; and by its very
prominence, perhaps, difficult to maintain.</p>

<p>Coming direct from the snow-clad hills and blood-stained
valley of the <i>Mauvaise Terre</i> of last winter’s central point of
interest, it can not be denied that an added chapter to Indian
history, and the Wild West’s province of truthfully exhibiting
the same, is rendered more valuable to the student of primitive
man, and to the ethnologist’s acquaintance with the
strange people whose grand and once happy empire (plethoric
in all its inhabitants needed) has been (rightfully or wrongfully)
brought thoroughly and efficiently under the control of
our civilization, or (possibly more candidly confessed) under
the Anglo-Saxon’s commercial necessities. It occurs to the
writer that our boasted civilization has a wonderful adaptability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
to the good soils, the productive portions, and the rich
mineral lands of the earth, while making snail-like pace and
intermittent efforts among the frigid haunts of the Esquimaux,
the tangled swamps of Africa, and the bleak and
dreary rocks of Patagonia.</p>

<p>A sentimental view is thus inspired, when long personal
association has brought the better qualities of the Indian to
one’s notice, assisting somewhat to dispel the prejudices
engendered by years of savage, brutal wars, conducted with
a ferocious vindictiveness foreign to our methods. The savageness
of Indian warfare is born in the victim, and probably
intensified by the instinctive knowledge of a despairing weakness
that renders desperate the fiery spirit of expiring resistance,
which latter (in another cause) might be held up for a
courage and tenacity as bright as that recorded in the pages
dedicated to the heroes of Thermopylæ.</p>

<p>After all, in what land, in what race, nationality, or community
can be found the vaunted vestal home of assured
peace? And where is human nature so perfected that circumstances
might not waken the dormant demon of man’s innate
savageness?</p>

<p>But then again the practical view of the non-industrious
use of nature’s cornucopia of world-needed resources and
the inevitable law of the <i>survival of the fittest</i> must bring the
“flattering unction to the soul” of those to whom the music
of light, work, and progress is the charm, the gauge of existence’s
worth, and to which the listless must hearken, the indolent
attend, the weak imbibe strength from&mdash;whose ranks the
red man must join, and advancing with whose steps march
cheerily to the tune of honest toil, industrious peace, and
placid fireside prosperity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
Passing through the to them marvelous experience of the
railroad and its flying express train; the sight of towns, villages,
cities, over valley, plain, and mountains to the magic
<i>floating house</i> (the steamer); sadly learning, while struggling
with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mal de mer</i>, the existence of the “big waters,” that
tradition alone had bruited to incredulous ears, was passed
the first portion of a tempestuous voyage. Its teachings were
of value in bringing to the proud spirits of the self-reliant
Dakotans the terrible power of nature, and of white man’s
marvelous skill, industry, and ability in overcoming the dangers
of the deep; the reward of patience being found in a
beautifully smooth approach to land. The Scilly Islands and
a non-fog-encumbered journey up the English Channel&mdash;unusually
bright with sunshine; the grand panorama of England’s
majestic shores, her passing fleet of all kinds of marine
architecture, the steaming up the river Scheldt, with its dyked
banks and the beautifully cultivated fields, opened to the marveling
nomad his first edition of Aladdin, and landed him&mdash;wonderingly
surprised at the sight of thousands of white men
peacefully greeting his arrival&mdash;in the busy commercial mart
of Antwerp.</p>

<p>After introducing the Indians to hotel life for the first
time, a tour of the city was made, among the notable points
visited being the cathedral, which grand edifice aroused their
curiosity; the grand picture, Rubens’ “Descent from the
Cross,” bringing to the minds of all&mdash;white men, “friendlies,”
and “hostiles”&mdash;the “Messiah craze”; all interest intensified
by the fact that the æsthetic-looking Short Bull and some of
the others had been the leading fanatical believers (probably
even apparently conscientious), promoters, and disciples of
the still mysterious religious disease that lately agitated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Indian race in America. In fact, after the death of Sitting
Bull the central figures of this strange belief were Short
Bull as the religious leader and Kicking Bear as the war
chief. Grouped together with Scatter, Revenge, and
others, in moody contemplation of this subject, was the late
defier of a mighty nation of 65,000,000 people, nearly all of
whom teach or preach the truthfulness of the picture’s traditions.
A man in two short months transported from the
indescribably desolate, almost inaccessible natural fortresses
of the Bad Lands (<i>Mauvaise Terre</i>) of Dakota to the ancient
city of Antwerp, gazing spellbound on the artistic reproduction
by the renowned artist of the red man’s late dream, “The
Messiah.” Respect for his thoughts and the natural stoical
nature of the Indian leaves to future opportunity an interesting
interrogative of what passed through the mind of the
subtle chief. Suffice it to say that surprise at the white man’s
many-sided character and the greatness of his resources in
the past and present was beginning to dawn more and more
on the new tourists. Arriving the next day at Strasburg,
introduction to the cowboys, the camp life, the cathedral, the
great clock, the fortifications, etc., was followed by the delight
of each brave on receiving his pony, and once more with his
trusty friend the horse, the Ogalalla and Brule in a few days
felt as though “Richard were himself again.”</p>

<p>Joining more heartily than was expected in the mimic
scenes of the Wild West, soon the ordinary routine of daily
duties seemed a pleasant diversion. A grand reception in
Strasburg, the tour resumed to Carlsruhe, Mannheim&mdash;including
a visit to Heidelberg Castle, Mayence, Wiesbaden,
Cologne (the Rhine legends of Lurline, etc., giving interest
to the Peau Rouge, en route), Dortmund, Duisburg, Crefeld,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
and Aix-la-Chapelle, terminated a tour of Germany filled with
the most pleasant recollections. The tomb of Charlemagne
(Carolo Magno)! The history of this great warrior was interpreted
to attentive ears, a lesson being instilled by the relation
that after all his glory, his battles, triumphs, and conquests
in which he defeated the dusky African prototypes of the
present visitors to his tomb, peace brought him to pursue
knowledge, to cultivate the arts and sciences, and that after a
hundred years of entombment his body was found by Otto
the Saxon sitting erect upon a granite throne, the iron crown
upon his head, imperial scepter in right hand, while his left
rested on an open volume of Holy Scriptures, the index
finger pointed to the well-known passage, “What will it profit
a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?”
Here by the grave of the founder of Christianity stood the
latest novitiates to its efforts, who may yet, in following its
teaching, it is hoped, make such progress through its aid and
education as to furnish one of their race capable of holding
the exalted chieftainship, the presidency in their native land&mdash;the
Empire of the West. Who can say? Why not?</p>

<p>Belgium&mdash;Brussels its Paris&mdash;brings vividly to mind, in its
semblance of language, people, habits, beauty, wealth, culture,
and appreciation, remembrance of our delightful sojourn in
the capital of (how truly named) la belle France. Visit
Waterloo! From Pine Ridge to historic Waterloo! The
courteous treatment and repeated visits and kindly interest of
that most amiable lady the queen&mdash;an enthusiastic horse-woman&mdash;her
pleasant reference to London in the Jubilee year,
combined to increase the gratitude the Wild West voyagers
felt for the treatment everywhere received in Europe since,
in 1887, the Wild West invaded old England and pitched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
their tents in the world’s metropolis, London. So after a
short season in Antwerp the motley cargo set sail across the
North Sea to make a farewell visit to their cousins of the isle,
revel in a common language (bringing a new pleasure to the
ear), hoping to deserve and receive a continuance of that
amicable appreciation of their humble efforts that the past
seemed to justify.</p>

<p>Returning to England was next to going home to the
wild Westerners, after wandering through foreign lands, and
they were welcomed as though indeed “cousins” in the real
sense of the word.</p>

<p>A tour was made which was most extensive, for exhibitions
were given in Leeds, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester,
Sheffield, Stoke-on-Trent, Nottingham, Leicester, Cardiff,
Bristol, Portsmouth, Glasgow, and then back to London,
where Colonel Cody gave a special entertainment in the
grounds of Windsor Castle before the queen and her invited
guests.</p>

<p>It was upon this occasion that Buffalo Bill was honored
with the presentation of an elegant souvenir from the queen,
while Mr. Salsbury and the writer were also remembered with
handsome gifts from her majesty.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>Thus concluded the second tour in Europe. The Wild
West had been received and treated with marked kindness by
every nation, every city, and by persons of every rank and of
every station&mdash;press, public, and officials. Every one had
shown a willingness to lend a helping hand and displayed a
fraternal interest and general appreciation toward them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
their country’s flag, so that returning home it is a pleasant
duty to record the same, believing that in presenting their
rough pictures of a “history almost passed away” some
moiety of good may have been done in simplifying the work
of the historian, the romancer, the painter, and the student of
the future, and in exemplifying in themselves and their experiences
the fact that “travel is the best educator,” and that
association and acquaintanceship dispel prejudice, create
breadth of thought, and enhance appreciation of the truism
that “one touch of nature makes the whole world akin.”</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Col. W. F. Cody (Buffalo Bill) and the London Workingmen’s
Association.</span></span></h2>

<p>On Saturday evening, October 1, 1892, a conference of
delegates from the various branches of the London Workingmen’s
association was held at the Wild West, when an illuminated
address was presented to Col. W.&nbsp;F. Cody.</p>

<p>The chair was occupied by Mr. George Potter, president
of the association, who was supported by Mr. Fred Whetstone,
vice-president; Mr. F. Wigington, treasurer; Mr. Robert
Wilson, secretary. There was a large attendance.</p>

<p>Colonel Cody was accompanied by Maj. John M. Burke
and Mr. Nate Salsbury.</p>

<p>Mr. George Potter, in presenting the address which congratulated
Buffalo Bill on the splendor of his show, its value
from an educational standpoint, and the success which had
attended his visit, now fast drawing to a close, said that those
whom he represented admired the colonel’s pluck and appreciated
his indomitable courage. He had taught us a lesson
which would not be forgotten, and Buffalo Bill would ever be
a household word with us. (Loud cheers.) Mr. Potter and
those with him expressed the hope that after Buffalo Bill had
visited the World’s Fair at Chicago and settled down in his
own country to dwell among his own people, he would enjoy
the remainder of his life in contentment, prosperity, and
peace. (Loud cheers.)</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Mr. Potter then read the following address:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="in0"><i>Col. W. F. Cody</i>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: The members of the London Workingmen’s Association,
representing large bodies of workingmen, have a friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
word to say at a time when your visit to this country is fast
drawing to a close.</p>

<p>They desire to approach you in a spirit of congratulation
and to place on record their thorough appreciation of the
enterprise and ability displayed by you in the conception and
creation of the brilliant realistic spectacle known as the Wild
West, fully realizing its magnitude and its value from an
educational standpoint as a vivid picture of past life on the
American frontier.</p>

<p>To those whose domestic cares and necessities prevent
them enjoying the luxury of travel and its acknowledged
advantages in forming proper ideas of foreign peoples and
strange races, your enterprise has brought not only entertainment
for the moment, but has enabled thousands to enjoy
more fully the books, histories, paintings, and sculpture that
come under their observation. This alone is something of
future value to every nation you have visited (among all
classes), as well as the fraternal feeling of the general brotherhood
of man that your introduction of national and racial
differences in one body for mutual instruction produces.</p>

<p>Neither the costly outlay through which these results
have been effected by the difficulties of presenting the best
specimens of these primitive peoples, nor the talent displayed
by the performers, could have secured the enormous audiences,
had not careful attention been paid to fidelity of depiction,
the mastery of detail, and ample provision for the comfort
of the public.</p>

<p>That the marked success of the undertaking is in a large
measure due to your own personal supervision affords an
additional ground for offering our meed of congratulation to
you as a workingman.</p>

<p>With this we couple our sincere hope that upon your future
retirement you may find, in well-earned repose, no reason to
regret your visits to England of 1887 and 1892; and you
may rest assured you carry with you the good wishes of the
millions whom you have so liberally entertained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Mr. Fred Whetstone (late chairman of the Amalgamated
Society of Engineers), in supporting the address, expressed
a wish from the bottom of his heart that the colonel would
have a safe and glorious passage and a successful career in
Chicago. (Loud cheers.)</p>

<p>Colonel Cody said he deeply felt the honor they had
bestowed upon him in the kindly expressions contained in the
address they had presented him with that evening. To deserve
their good-will was a source of satisfaction greater than mere
words could express. (Cheers.) He hoped that time and
opportunity would enable him to extend to them an American
hospitality in his own land, where sunshine and prosperity met
men in every walk of life. (Cheers.) He hoped they would
excuse him, for he was very ill, but presently he would try to
come up smiling, whether he felt it or not. (Loud cries of
“Bravo.”)</p>

<p>The delegates then sat down to a substantial tea, after
which the following toasts were proposed:</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Wilson (secretary to the association) in a very
interesting speech proposed “Health and Prosperity to Mr.
Nate Salsbury.” This was seconded by Mr. T.&nbsp;P. Lind of
the East End organizations, and supported by Mr. Thomas
Cornish, mining engineer. The toast was accepted with loud
cheers and accompanied with musical honors.</p>

<p>Mr. Nate Salsbury, who was most enthusiastically received,
responded in a powerful and eloquent speech, in which he
referred to the friendly feelings that existed between the
peoples of England and America, and concluded by expressing
his pleasure at being present that evening.</p>

<p>Mr. F. Wigington (of the lightermen and watermen of
the River Thames) proposed “Health and Prosperity to Maj.
John M. Burke,” which was seconded by Mr. Thomas Armstrong
(patternmakers), supported by Mr. H. Le Fevre
(president of the Balloon Society), and carried with acclamation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
Major Burke, who was received with great cordiality,
responded in a humorous and interesting speech, which was
heartily received.</p>

<p>During the evening each member was presented with a
portrait of Buffalo Bill, bearing his autograph; after which
they witnessed a performance of the Wild West Show, and
altogether enjoyed a most pleasant entertainment.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="EPISODE" id="EPISODE"></a>AN EPISODE SINCE THE RETURN FROM EUROPE.</h2>

<p>When abroad Buffalo Bill heard so many officers of the
army of France, England, and other countries ask about the
Wild West of America, its game and wonderful scenery, that
he extended an invitation to a number of gentlemen of rank
and title to join him, with others from this country, on an
extended expedition to the Grand Cañon of the Colorado,
and thence on through Arizona and Utah to Salt Lake City
on horseback.</p>

<p>Various causes prevented many from accepting the invitation,
but a number assembled at Scout’s Rest Ranch, the home
of Colonel Cody at North Platte, Neb., and started upon the
long and adventurous trail of a thousand miles in the saddle.
The following are those who went on the expedition:</p>

<p>Col. W. F. Cody (Buffalo Bill); Col. Frank D. Baldwin,
U.&nbsp;S. Army; Col. W.&nbsp;H. MacKinnon, Grenadier Guards, England;
Maj. St. John Mildmay, Grenadier Guards; Col. Allison
Nailor, Washington, D.&nbsp;C.; Maj. John M. Burke (Arizona
John); Col. Prentiss Ingraham, Washington, D.&nbsp;C.; Hon.
George P. Everhart, Chicago, Ill.; Elder Daniel Seigmiller,
Utah; Elder Junius Wells, Utah; Robert H. Haslam (Pony
Bob); Horton S. Boal, Nebraska; Edward Bradford, Denver,
Colo.; William B. Dowd, New York; John Hance, Guide of
Grand Cañon of the Colorado.</p>

  <div class="caption">BUFFALO BILL’S LASSO TO THE RESCUE.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
Going by rail to Denver, then down into New Mexico to
Flagstaff, Arizona, the party found there a wagon outfit and
horses, with an escort of nearly half a hundred Mormon
scouts, guides, and cowboys.</p>

<p>They took the trail to the Grand Cañon of the Colorado,
hunting as they went along, then by a long flank movement
through the Navajo Country, they crossed at Lee’s Ferry,
thence going on to the Kaibal Mountains, viewing the grandest
scenery on earth, and enjoying the sport of hunting bear,
mountain lions, mountain sheep, elk, deer, antelope, turkey,
ducks, and catching fine trout and other fish.</p>

<p>Caught in several blizzards on the mountains, and following
unknown trails, many perilous adventures were met with
on the expedition, but fortunately no life was lost, though one
adventure well nigh proved fatal to Major Mildmay of the
Grenadier Guards, giving an opportunity to Colonel Cody
to show his nerve in sudden danger and his skill with a lasso
as well, for, but for his quick act, horse and rider would have
run over a precipice a couple of thousand feet down to the
valley below.</p>

<p>The expedition left the trail at Salt Lake City and returned
via Wyoming and Colorado, back to the East, thus ending
Colonel Cody’s last trail upon the frontier, though if there
should occur another border war, he would at once be found
at his old post.</p>
